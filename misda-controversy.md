# The Michigan Conference Controversy: Thoughts and Perspectives

The Michigan Conference of Seventh-day Adventists has recently been embroiled in controversy, much of it surrounding the banning of Elder Conrad Vine from speaking in Michigan pulpits and the subsequent removal of his pastor, Ron Kelly, from leadership of the Village Seventh-day Adventist Church in Berrien Springs. The focus of discussion has tended to center around the personalities involved. I hope that the thoughts collected on this page can help refocus the conversation on the deeper issues at stake.

I may keep adding to this page, so check back periodically for new content.
