# About me

![Photo of me backpacking](/assets/images/backpacking.jpg)

I grew up in Northern California and currently live in Central Michigan with my wife and daughter. I'm a licensed Professional Engineer with experience in structural design for commercial and industrial applications. When I'm not at work, I enjoy hiking, composing music, studying ancient Greek, woodworking, LEGO, and more. My wife and I have both lived and worked in several countries and enjoy learning about other languages and cultures.
