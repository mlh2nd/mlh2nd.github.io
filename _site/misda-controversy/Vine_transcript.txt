[Music]
0:09
I'm actually partially deaf in my left ear I'm not sure why but when I sleep I always sleep on
0:16
my right side so my good ear is covered up when I sleep and my wife often tells me things
0:22
at night when I'm asleep when I'm in bed and she can
0:28
legitimately say in the morning but I told you so I can say yes but I didn't hear you so and it's a wonderful compromise to have
0:34
in life so uh thank you so much for helping the audio visual here that music was
0:40
beautiful yes yes and um you know the trumpet is one of my favorite
0:46
instruments I love the trumpet anded from handle's Messiah for the trumpet shall Death Shall sound the dead shall
0:52
be raised it's a beautiful piece of music I'm maybe sure Pastor David you've played that somewhere but it's a
0:57
beautiful piece and I love the trumpet because has a certain tone to it there's a tone to it and people recognize when a
1:03
trumpet is being played because a trumpet has the ability to cut through all the surrounding
1:09
noise and so uh tonight is the second uh this is called broken bride part three
1:14
tomorrow in Sabbath School in that's at least the Sabbath School hour I'll be doing broken bride one I'm going be
1:20
talking about um the the Antichrist in scripture and the modern ecumenical movement and where it's leading uh so
1:27
you want to be around for that uh tomorrow night I'm speak speaking about the bride of Christ um and God as a
1:32
Divine divorce and the the wedding supper of the Lamb that we're all looking forward to and how God gives his
1:38
Saints a clobe of righteousness to be ready for that glorious day and tonight I'm going to be talking it's called
1:44
broken bride number three I've entitled this Remnant respectable or regime
1:50
church and uh I I I want to say at the outset that I don't look forward to many
1:55
of the sermons that I give I I don't look forward to them I I God lays a burden upon my heart and I
2:02
say' no Lord I don't want to preach it but then he says I need you to write this down so I write it down and then I said but Lord I don't want to preach it
2:09
and he says no but this this a chance there you're going to preach it there and said Lord I don't want to preach it but then it seems to happen that way and
2:16
so um there are sometimes you preach a sermon um maybe for a wedding or for a funeral and you're kind of looking
2:22
forward to that um weddings are joyous occasions and they're nice to preach for
2:27
funerals are nicer to preach for because nothing worse can go wrong and so it doesn't really matter if you misspeak in
2:34
a funeral um it doesn't really matter but weddings with with Blended families
2:40
these days you can have um two biological mothers and two stepmothers walking wanting or walk down the aisle
2:46
in the practice and you nobody ever quite knows who goes first and who goes last it gets really complex these days
2:53
so uh anyway I'm going to preach tonight on the remnants the respectable the regime church I want to preface it by um
2:59
just REM izing what I said last night what we said in the question answer session here today is that what happened
3:04
in the last three years was not the mark of the beast that we're all Brothers and Sisters in Christ that it is it does not
3:11
put you in the Lamb's Book of Life or out of the Lamb's Book of Life depending on the choices that any one of us made
3:16
in the last three to four years and it's time for us to kind of catch our breaths and take a look back because we know
3:23
what's coming in the future and so I'm using this opportunity here to reflect um some more on what happened and what
3:29
it points out to us in the future because we know that more mandates are coming maybe of vaccines but certainly
3:35
relating to false worship and the question of worship which we find all the way through the Book of Revelation
3:40
chapters 12 and 13 so um before we open the word of God and we open our sermon
3:45
together let's bow our heads and ask for the presence of the holy spirit so shall we pray Heavenly
3:52
Father we thank you that the Sabbath hours are now upon us Lord as Dr Sydney uh welcom Us in
4:00
with the those words of welcome and talking about the lighting of the candle I pray Lord that as the darkness of our
4:06
world gathers around us so the light of our witness will shine brighter and brighter for you Lord I pray that during
4:13
these Sabbath hours each one of us will come to a deeper faith in Jesus Christ father I pray that as a result of being
4:19
at this camp meeting through the singing the preaching uh the Practical uh Seminars the classes I pray Lord that
4:27
our witness for Jesus will burn ever brighter from this day forward now Lord as I I I preach this sermon Lord I I
4:34
thank you for giving it to me and Lord I pray that be a faithful servant and discharging this
4:39
responsibility Lord I Thank you for hearing this prayer in Jesus name I ask amen so last night we looked at the
4:46
question of what are the administrative boundaries within the SDA church and
4:51
when somebody says that something is an administrative item that has been dealt with um what are the boundaries within
4:57
our structure and I came to the conclusion in my study on that and I hope we all came to the conclusion
5:03
ourselves that um while we are delighted and grateful that our church leaders at
5:08
the conference the union the division the GC level while we are thankful that they do what they do and they many of
5:13
them have very um thankless tasks there is a boundary of which they cannot cross
5:19
and actually our church conf our conference leaders our Union division GC leaders have precisely zero authority
5:26
over any aspect of Our Lives zero they cannot vote for anything in my life or
5:31
your life it's just a matter of fact they cannot determine where you live who you marry what you wear what you eat
5:37
what you um spend your money on they cannot determine what job you have what part of the country you live in if you
5:42
move from Maine to Minnesota then down to Florida you don't have to ask anybody's permission about that um you
5:48
are a free moral agent and each one of us is accountable before God for the decisions that we make on a daily basis
5:55
it is not that we are amoral beings it is not that we are unaccountable beings we are morally accountable before our
6:01
heavenly father for how we live our lives and so while we affirm uh the fact that church leaders have no authority
6:07
over the members they cannot make any decisions for our lives that does not mean that we are free of moral
6:13
accountability as uh as Dr Steve said earlier Sydney said earlier there are angels in in this in this house there
6:19
are the Heavenly Watchers we read about in The Book of Daniel and the Heavenly Watchers saw what B shaza was doing in
6:24
his mocking of God in his feast and because they noted what he was doing he brought judgment upon himself so we are
6:32
moral beings every word every deed every action is transcribed in the records of Heaven the Watchers are around us and we
6:38
will one day have to give account for every word and every deed um in that final judgment but tonight I want to
6:45
look at the question of whether we are a Remnant Church a respectable church or a
6:51
regime church and uh that's the the journey we're going to go on today so um make
6:58
try and make sure this thing works here um as I said last night there's deep fake videos appearing all over the world
7:04
these days so I set up a YouTube channel it's conradine youtube.com I'd encourage
7:10
you to subscribe to it just because I try and post my sermons there when I find them on the internet I don't post
7:16
my own videos but other if other people do and it's genuine I'll post it there so i' invite you to subscribe there and
7:21
then you'll see at least I think I genuine videos of myself um there may be fake videos out there but that'll be a
7:28
genuine website there so this is our journey tonight we're going to look at some previous GC and Ira statements on
7:34
religious liberty I'll come to Ira in a minute I'm going to talk about the fact that the truth matters I'm going to look
7:40
at the impact of the reaffirmation statement on Adventists and what are the implications for us in the final crisis
7:46
like how do we respond and should these events come our way in the future so
7:51
we're going to start out by looking at GC and Ira statements on religious liberty now we we're familiar what the
7:56
word GC stands for that's a general conference and that's like the highest conference in our church that organizes
8:02
the world missionary work but the IR laa was established over 130 years ago it is
8:08
the international religious liberty Association it was established by our world's church over 130 years ago
8:15
because back in the day in the 1870s and 1880s we were convicted and convinced that Liberty of conscience is going to
8:22
be the Battleground in the final crisis between good and evil and I'm convinced of that today and you can look up the
8:28
iraa the international religious liberty Association States run by the general conference it has delegates from all
8:33
around the world Church in it and they produce some powerful statements and every few years they have a congress so
8:40
we're going to look at some of the statements that have come out of this organization there's their website there the international religious liberty
8:46
Association it's IR la.org I'd encourage you to check it out there are some fascinating resources there if you're a
8:53
religious liberty leader in your local congregation you want to take note of these things and I encourage you just to
8:58
take may take advantage of this actually the church has an incredible wealth of information and resources out there but
9:05
the average member has no idea exists and I would encourage you to start looking at say the North American
9:11
Division website or the union websites because they often have a plethora of resources out there that are very
9:17
helpful for local churches and for you in your family and in your marriage and we as regular members we often have no
9:23
idea it exists many of these stuff things have got different brands on them they're not all linked to one website
9:28
you have to go hunting for them but this is a very very helpful website here the IRA and the iraa voted some statements
9:37
over the years in fact back in 1897 I think it was the iraa the the Adventist
9:42
Church had a set of like they didn't call it fundamental beliefs but they they published a list of principles that
9:48
we stand for and I think it was number 17 stated that one of the core principles we stand for was Liberty of
9:53
conscience it was actually you might say an original version of our fundamental beliefs and we actually listed Liberty
10:00
of conscience as one of our core beliefs uh back in the 1890s so from
10:06
1893 you know I've I've leared over the years that it's worth going to when when somebody dies this is a hint for
10:12
everybody here when somebody dies go to their house and ask The Grieving children if you could take a look at the
10:19
library because these days people don't want the old books on the shelves but you find real jewels on those shelves
10:27
real treasures and a good library is a labor of love I'll tell you why because
10:32
for every 10 books that I read I give away eight is not worth having so if I give you a present you need to think
10:39
very carefully I give away eight because they're not worth having but I keep two because they're really good there
10:45
seminal books in their area of study and so over the course of 10 20 30 40 Years of reading you eventually end up with a
10:52
library that all the books been read multiple times and those are like the core books in each of those areas and um
10:57
you know I have other books my my my bed collapsed a number of years ago uh there's there's the um mattress there's
11:04
the Box Thing underneath it and I've got these steel struts across and they collapsed so my wife said what are we
11:09
going to do about it I said well people keep giving me books um nobody from Maine let me under emphasize this no
11:16
books from Maine are under my book under my bed and so I stack the books under my bed and so when somebody says did you
11:23
like the book I said I keep it close to my head when I sleep which is very true so um but I've discovered that when you
11:30
go to uh when somebody dies tragically and you go and visit the family take a look at the books on the shelves because
11:37
more and more people these days they don't want to be troubled by the old those old dusty Library volumes but you
11:42
find real Treasures on those shelves and I'd encourage you to do that
11:48
and um I went to somebody's house recently who passed away and I picked up a little red book I thought it was one
11:53
of sister white's books and then when I got it home I inspected it a bit more closely and it was was um some
11:59
Publications from 1893 from the international religious liberty Association I was stunned I did not know
12:05
this resource existed it was published by that what what then was our general conference back in the day and I was
12:11
reading through it and there were all kinds of sermons from at Jones in it all kinds of other things fascinating stuff
12:17
and I came across some of these statements so listen to these statements this is what we stood for back in 1893
12:22
says this man's first and highest Allegiance in all things is due to his
12:28
creator therefore the domain of conscience is one which human government whether of one or of many has no right
12:34
to invade no man can surrender his conscience to the keeping of another and
12:40
maintain his loyalty to God but as a moral as a responsible moral being he
12:45
must remain loyal to his creator at whatever cost even at the sacrifice of life itself and so just as the first
12:53
amendment with freedom of religion is that is it the foundational relig in foundational rights in our Bill of
12:59
Rights so um Liberty of conscience is the foundational religious freedom in the government of heaven and when God
13:07
created Adam in chapter two of the Book of Genesis uh the very first thing he said to him before he said anything else
13:13
was you may eat of every tree in this Garden but of that one tree the knowledge of the of the tree of the
13:18
knowledge of Good and Evil you shall not eat of it and so the very first thing that God affirmed to Adam was that we
13:24
are moral beings accountable to our Heavenly Creator and our conscience is is accountable to our Heavenly Creator
13:30
and not to anybody else 1893 ww Prescott wrote this in a
13:36
sermon called Christ and the Sabbath he says it is a characteristic of Satan to compel and every effort to compel in any
13:44
of the consciences of men is what satanic every effort to compel the consciences of men in any way whether it
13:51
be the Sabbath or any other matter at issue is satanic God wins by the power
13:56
of love amen God leaves everyone to choose Satan tries to compel every
14:02
effort to compel the conscience is satanic and the results will be satanic
14:08
so there we are a sermon by WW Prescott one of our early church leaders in that religious liberty library from
14:15
1893 we then had a declaration of principles that were voted by our church leaders back in
14:21
1893 and on the left hand side you have the Declaration one of those principles it says there we believe it is the right
14:28
and should be the privilege of every man to worship according to the dictates of his conscience now you have a scripture
14:35
reference on the right from Romans 12 and verse one and then uh skip forward 140 years
14:43
and come to the 21st or 23d of August 2023 and um every year the general
14:50
conference has two meetings there's the spring meetings and there's the annual Council which is normally in October and
14:57
um that those two meetings where the major decisions get taken between General Conference sessions and then the
15:02
Adcom of conf General Conference meets every month to deal with the the uh the the the issues as they come up um but um
15:09
every year every every couple of years the iraa has a Congress and the last World Congress of the iraa was in August
15:17
2023 and the the general conference the department leader for public affairs and religious Liberties a man called Dr
15:23
Ganon Diop some of you are familiar with him and he was the uh the instrument of
15:28
the archit of the church's statement in 21 uh denying religious liberty objections on
15:33
the part of Adventists to mandates but um despite that in 2023 this is what he
15:39
was preaching in the ira Congress in the general conference building in August 23
15:45
he said religious liberty is quote the right to profess practice and propagate
15:50
one's beliefs without coercion intimidation or manipulation he went on
15:55
to Define religious liberty as quote freedom freedom from being forced to do something that is against one's deeply
16:01
held convictions or against one's conscience end of quote and so he
16:07
explicitly recognized that religious liberty involves upholding your Liberty of conscience and your Liberty of
16:13
conscience it doesn't give you the freedom to do as you wish it means that you are no longer a slave to sin you're
16:19
are now a slave to righteousness it's not that we are become amoral beings the liberty of
16:25
conscience means that we are slaves to to to to righteous we are Servants of our loving heavenly
16:31
father and with the freedom that God gives us we are to serve one another in love as per the Apostle Paul so Dr Ganon
16:40
Diop went on to say at annual Council in October last year he said human conscience is sacred it must not be
16:47
violated by anyone it is sacrilegious to constrain or pressure people to do
16:53
something against the dictates of their conscience now this was the man who put
16:59
together the statement denying Liberty of conscience in the pandemic but this is what he says when
17:05
the pandemic is over human conscience is sacred it must not be violated by anyone
17:11
it is sacrilegious to constrain or pressure people to do something against the dictates of their conscience he goes
17:18
on to say this h no man is to think that he is the owner of the minds and capabilities of his Brethren he is not
17:25
to think the others must submit to his dictation he is liable to her liable to
17:30
make mistakes as every man is he is not to try to control matters in accordance
17:35
with his ideas and this particular quote here um is taken from the book this day
17:42
this day with God by Sister white page 192 he then had another quote from the spirit of Prophecy and this particular
17:48
one here from councils on Health page 345 uh this is what he quoted in the annual Council last year at the general
17:55
conference he said it is not God's purpose that any human being should yield yield his mind and will to the
18:00
control of another becoming a passive instrument in his hands no one is to merge his individuality in in that of
18:07
another he is not to look to any other human being as the source of healing his dependence must be in who in God it is
18:15
that in the Dignity of his god-given manhood he is to be controlled by God himself Not By Any Human intelligence
18:23
this is a quote there from councils on Health page 345 and Dr ganun Diop was
18:28
corre corly and rightly reflecting these very powerful statements from writings of sister white um that that uphold the
18:35
basic truth that we are created in the image of God as moral beings as morally accountable beings and we are
18:41
accountable to our Heavenly Father for every word and every deed in our lives and there was no question about this I I
18:48
once um quoted this to my wife about my mother-in-law not being controlled by her and she didn't see the humor in that
18:54
particular comment some of you will so the um but then just just to remind
19:01
ourselves as we discussed last night this is the key paragraph in the October 21 reaffirmation statement where Dr
19:08
Ganon Diop um because it says there the sth Adventist Church in consultation with the health ministries that's Dr
19:14
Peter landas and the public affairs and religious liberty department that's Dr Ganon Diop who in 2023 is such a
19:20
champion of individual liberty of conscience they are convinced that's good news that the vaccination programs
19:25
that are generally been carried out are important for the safety and health of our members members and the larger Community therefore and this is this is
19:32
the key sentence claims of religious liberty are not used appropriately in objecting to government mandates or
19:38
employeer programs designed to protect the health and safety of their communities now what is a religious
19:44
liberty objection a religious liberty objection by definition is where the Holy Spirit convicts you not to do
19:51
something when the church says that the holy spir that you cannot say that the holy spirit is convicting you not to do
19:57
something this small group of men here are assuming the rights to override the holy
20:03
spirit this is wrong doesn't matter what the issue is doesn't matter whether it's vaccinations or pork or beer or anything
20:09
else in this passage here our church leaders assumed the right to override
20:14
the convictions of the Holy Spirit upon each of your consciences and if they assume the right yesterday they've
20:21
established a precedent that can be used tomorrow once again to hurt the members that is why we're talking about this
20:27
today because more mandate are coming in 18 in 1923 the general conference voted in
20:34
full session this vote it's an interesting vote and um you've got to go digging through the the dusty books to
20:40
find things like this but this is what we voted in 1923 it says there as American citizens and this was actually
20:47
an appeal to the US federal government so this vote was an appeal to the federal government in Washington DC and
20:53
this is what we voted we said as American citizens we Appeal on the ground of specific declared
20:59
constitutional rights to the free exercise of religion according to the dictates of the individual conscience
21:05
totally free and exempt from all government connection interference or control but religion or the duty which
21:11
we owe to our creator and the manner of discharging it can be directed only by reason and conviction and is nowhere
21:18
cognizable but at the tri tribunal of the universal judge we maintain therefore that in matters of religion no
21:25
man's right is Abridged by the institution of Civil Society and that religion is wholly exempt from its
21:31
cognizance we therefore as Christians as Protestants as American citizens and as men appealing to the Supreme judge of
21:38
the world that is God himself for the rectitude of our intentions solemnly publish and declare that we are and of
21:44
right ought to be free and independent of all connection Direction dictation
21:49
interference or control of the governments of the United States in matters of religion or religious observances or religious institutions of
21:56
any kind or degree that's a powerful statement we voted that in 1923 and we
22:03
sent it to the federal government affirming that we are morally accountable to God and we do not accept
22:09
any government actions that would interfere with the free exercise of religion now as it happens you may ask
22:15
this question um in America we don't have the absolute right to the free exercise of religion because the Supreme
22:22
Court has held that in things let's say as child sacrifice you cannot sacrifice a living child in the pursuit of your
22:28
religious observances okay so we don't have an absolutely un Untamed absolutely unrestricted unrestricted right to
22:36
religious freedom and so um there is there is the right to practice in in the
22:41
First Amendment and there is also the the lack the the right to be free of a state Church in the First Amendment as
22:47
well but our religious observance is not an absolute right in the Bill of Rights because some things have been restricted
22:53
by the Supreme Court such as child sacrifice so um this particular
22:59
statement here if you put this statement this vote of the General Conference in full session next to the October re
23:06
affirmation statement you put them side by side the statement on the left is what we voted in full session and
23:12
according to our constitution what is the highest Authority in our church is it the Adcom or is it the GC in a full
23:18
session okay so therefore every decisions of the adcoms which are lower
23:23
committee than the GC in full session must be consistent with the GC votes in full session session and cannot overturn
23:30
or undermine the votes of the GC in full session does that make sense absolutely so our GC vote in full session of
23:37
February 1893 says we are and of right ought to be free and independent of all connection Direction dictation
23:43
interference or control of the government of the United States in matters of religion or religious observances or religious institutions of
23:51
any kind or degree that would include offering your
23:56
body as a Living Sacrifice for a holy God that statement there overrides the
24:02
October reaffirmation statement of 21 which says claims of religious liberty are not used appropriately in objecting
24:08
to government mandates that statement by our Adcom goes directly against what our full session voted in
24:14
1893 therefore it's null and void because the Adcom cannot override a vote
24:19
of the full church and full session now you may say well that past F that was
24:24
1430 years apart but we're still Bound by principles
24:31
established in the Garden of Eden 7,000 years ago what is a mere 130
24:36
years truth is truth no matter when it is spoken or when it where it was spoken and so just on this basis alone
24:44
the October 21 at reaffirmation statement is null and void and should never have been voted and has no
24:49
standing because it cannot override the GC VOE in full session of
24:55
1893 so these are various stat ments that we've made as a church in our past
25:01
and so I want to talk now about why the truth matters and would you agree with me that
25:06
truth matters yes um gentlemen if if your if your if your wife says to you do do does
25:13
this dress make me look um fat that's that's where you have to decide whether the truth really does
25:19
matter or not that's an awward question to answer um I have learned with my wife
25:27
and I have a lovely gracious wife wife when she says did you like that meal I said I really liked it I said and I
25:33
really appreciate what you made yesterday as well and the subtle hint is make what
25:38
you made yesterday again please um but also because you know I you heard the
25:44
story of me slicing my thumb off into the soup yes some of you um I'm truly
25:49
grateful for whenever my wife makes me a hot meal which is almost every day and um so I'm basically a kept man all I
25:56
have to do is preach and go to the office that's my in life um the story of my thumb do you know the story of my
26:03
thumb some of you must know it my wife came home from her wisdom teeth were
26:09
taken out and I brought her home and she said to me um she went up to the bedroom
26:14
and she would lay down to rest and sleep off the the remnants of the anesthesia and when she was kind of somewhat with
26:20
it she says could you make me um vegetable soup and I've never made a vegetable soup in my life but I thought well how
26:26
hard can this be you boil some water and you chop up some vegetables and it just turns into soup doesn't it so I went
26:34
downstairs and I B put a pot on the on the stove and I was boiling the pot of water and I went and I got some potatoes
26:40
and I sliced and diced them I put them in the water and I'm not really I'm not very good with my hands I can I can type
26:46
almost at the speed I think and speak but other than that I'm not very practical with my hands um and so I'm
26:52
very clumsy with my hands and so um I I I chopped up the tomatoes I chopped up the celery anything I could find in the
26:58
fridge was chopped up and put in that pot and um I remembered that there's something called like little little
27:05
little cubes and some some some sometimes Wife puts in I have no idea what they are so I went and found some
27:10
cubes and crumbled them up and I got a little teaspoon of Marmite and put it in to add a bit of proper flavor to it and
27:16
and then I realized oh I I need I need to add some beetroot so I chopped up some beetroot and you know pushed it in
27:22
and I need some carrots so I got the carrots and I was grating the carrots and um I was grating it vigorously and
27:27
hard I wanted to get this job over and done with and I wasn't paying attention to what I was doing and then suddenly I had this stabbing pain in my right thumb
27:34
and I looked down and I'd sliced off about a third of the nail with the flesh underneath it which had now gone into the pot of
27:40
soup and um it was a most um for a
27:46
moment these pre-christian thoughts flashed across my mind and I stood there and kind of like
27:51
stunned silence as the blood kind of welled up and ripped into the soup what do I do now and so I went to the forets
27:58
and I run some cold water which is very painful actually on the raw flesh there and so what do I do so I got some toilet
28:05
paper or tissue paper and I kind of pressed it on to kind of St um stop the bleeding and finally I put a Band-Aid on
28:10
it and it kind of stopped bleeding and that bled through a bit more so put another Band-Aid around the white toilet paper and eventually it looked like okay
28:17
this is going to hold then I had to go back to the soup to find my missing flesh and missing piece of of of nails I
28:24
couldn't find it in there um because i' already put the beetroot in so I um what what this is a moral
28:31
dilemma yes what do I do um but I thought that um she won't
28:37
mind so I I [Laughter] got so I got the um the
28:46
blender and I put the blender in and um and uh uh my sins were covered over by a
28:53
multitude of love and I took it up to my I took the bowl of soup up to my wife feeling very much like Jacob coming
28:59
before Isaac and I gave it to my wife and watched somewhat nervously um as she as
29:05
she ate it and pronounced it delicious when she'd eaten it and pronounced it delicious she said what happened to your
29:12
thumb and this is where the truth really does matter you know so I said to her well you know in
29:19
the Bible it says that um Adam says this is at last this at last is bone of my
29:24
bones and Flesh of My Flesh do you believe this and when when it says um
29:29
the man leaves his father his mother and clings to his wife and they become one flesh do you believe this she says well
29:35
I guess I do I then I confessed my sins and confession is good for the soul they say um my wife um is very very reserved
29:45
but I could tell from the look in her eye that I hadn't hit a home run with that particular incident and so uh
29:51
anyway the solution the net result to that is I've been banned from making food for the family in the kitchen um
29:56
which is one of the burdens I be in life so anyway now the point
30:04
is the point is that the truth matters the truth matters and it matters particularly in
30:11
areas of medicine because if I go to my doctor and I trust my doctor I have a really good doctor and she's become kind
30:16
of used to my quirks over the last 13 years and um we have a good relationship
30:21
and I trust my doctor and I want to trust my doctor my wife was raised in the Soviet Union where doctors were used
30:29
when people where Christians were put in mental Mental Hospitals they were injected with various drugs to make them
30:34
go mad okay this is what happened in the Soviet Union and so people in the Soviet
30:40
Union doctors were agents of the state and if the state wanted to kill you or the state wants to make you go mad then
30:45
the doctor did what he or she was instructed um but here in America we still have the idea that the doctor does
30:51
what is right for the patient and so I love my doctor you know she does a really good job for me and um I went to
30:57
see my doctor and if I go to the doctor and let's say I've got a problem with you know I don't know got a pain in my
31:03
back and she says Mr Vine how are you doing this year and and I said well actually you know I've got a problem
31:08
with my right knee it hurts every time I bend it my doctor is going to do perform you know a physical examination and
31:14
she's probably going to be baffled at why my right knee is allegedly hurting and the chances of me getting a correct
31:19
diagnosis and the right treatment plan for the pain in my back I'm pretty much zero because there has to be
31:25
truthfulness in the clinical relationship if there is no truthfulness in the Consulting room whether it's with a
31:31
psychologist dealing with depression or with um an ENT surgeon dealing with a problem with your with your nasal
31:36
passages or with your family physician you have a problem with your back if there is no truthfulness Then There can
31:42
there can be no healing so truth matters the truth absolutely matters we have
31:48
tragic cases in our Western World the thalidomide Scandal or in fisa in in
31:54
2009 paid out $2.3 billion in Damages for misbranding a drug called bextra
32:01
with the intent to defraud or mislead and that's what was found in the courts so the truth matters as Adventists we
32:07
want to Proclaim Eternal truth so we have a responsibility to seek truth and speak the truth because when we speak
32:14
the truth that is the starting point for healing when there's been difficulty in a relationship are we with me on this
32:21
all right so I want to talk now just for a few minutes about the truth and on the
32:27
left you have the the official narrative and on the right you've got the counter narrative the official narrative was the
32:33
CDC NIH fouy mainstream media General Conference on the right you got the counts narrative which was the great
32:39
barington declaration scientists Physicians and Truth Seekers worldwide so the official narrative was the virus
32:45
did not come from Wuhan Institute of orology the counil narrative says it probably did come from the W the Wuhan
32:51
Institute of orology the official narrative says as per fouchy in Congress repeatedly there's no federally funded
32:57
gain of function research at Wuhan we now know that there was Federal funding for illegal F gain of function research
33:04
on bat Corona viruses at Wuhan the official narrative was the virus had a random Zoological origin at
33:11
a wet markets in Wuhan there known as the the theory of proximal Origins which was drummed up almost overnight to
33:18
divert attention from Wuhan and the counts narrative is that the virus did not originate in a wet Market in Wuhan
33:24
now we know that's almost certainly to be certainly to be true because every virus has a reservoir an animal
33:30
Reservoir where it resides and the Chinese government has been looking for the animal reservoir for this virus and
33:36
three years later they still cannot find it which tells you if there was no animal Reservoir it did not come from the Animal Kingdom the official
33:42
narrative was there was no effective therapeutic options for the treatment of covid other than the vaccines the counts
33:49
narrative said that there were highly effective Outpatient Treatment protocols for covid-19 the official narrative said
33:56
those who took the vaccines would neither get covid or transmit the virus to another person the counter narrative
34:02
was the vaccines they may alleviate the symptoms in that case they may save lives in that sense but they do not
34:08
prevent someone Contracting covid nor do they prevent transmission to another person that was actually known from the
34:14
very first emergency use authorization given for the fiser shots because they actually said in the public the PA
34:20
release um from the ni and the CDC that there is no evidence that these vaccines prevent Transmissions this was known
34:26
from day one the official narrative was the vaccines were safe and effective the counter narrative is that one by one the
34:32
vaccines have been banned all around the world because of catastrophic side effects that's the reality the official
34:39
narrative was that the vaccines provided full immunity from covid-19 and if you take the shot you won't get it but the
34:46
counter narrative is every time a patient was vaccinated only the manufacturer the medical personnel
34:51
involved the hospital system and the employer Who mandated the shots only they acquired full immunity and that was
34:56
legal not Medical the official narrative was if you take the shot you won't get covid-19 that's
35:01
what President Biden said on CNN the account narrative is that the more boosters you get the more likely you are
35:07
today to get covid-19 the official narrative was that social distancing and maske wearing were
35:12
based on science we now know as per fouchy that social distancing and maske wearing rules were simply made up on the
35:19
spot without any underlying scientific basis the official narrative was that
35:24
any person deviating from the official narrative was spreading misinformation and their career was to be destroyed
35:30
through professional social and financial Council culture the counter narrative was that uh the reality was
35:37
that truth speakers and the unvaccinated were demonized including in our church the counts narrative is that absolute
35:43
truth still matters in a post-modern era of moral relativism and personal subjectivity and the counts narrative
35:49
asserts that truth has profound personal and social consequences if it is rejected by
35:56
Society now we this is with the benefit of hindsight and some of you may dispute
36:03
some of the things I've said here tonight but I would based on all I have seen and read almost everything in the
36:09
official narrative was false and it was known to be false at the time by those pushing it almost everything in the
36:16
counts narrative was true and those who are now Vindicated as the official narrative has fully collapsed around us
36:22
under the weight of its own falsehoods they were demonized by the mainstream media and by the general conference
36:28
through 2020 through 2022 my wife grew up in the Soviet Union
36:34
and at the Soviet Union had very famous dissident you had Alexander solnit in the 60s and 70s in the in the 1980s you
36:41
had famous dissidents like Andre sakaro maybe some of you remember that name he was a nuclear physicist who disagreed
36:47
with the path the Soviet Union was going on and in the Adventist Church in the Soviet Union there was the official
36:52
church and they sent their kids to school on the Sabbath and there was The Unofficial Adventist known as the true and free Adventists and they were kind
36:59
of basically demonized by the official Adventists and they did not send their children to school on the Sabbath and my
37:05
wife when she became an Adventist in 94 995 when the Soviet Union had collapsed and L evangelist spread from America all
37:12
across the former Soviet Union she she remarked to me she said that um these people who were demonized some of these
37:18
um in the church and Society there were many people who were demonized by Society by the Soviet Union and by the
37:25
church for being underground Adventists they were demonized ized before 1990 but they were celebrated as heroes from 1991
37:33
onwards and she says to me that the individuals did not change society changed around them and one minute you
37:41
are demonized by society and the next minute you are celebrated by Society one
37:46
minute you're put in labor camps and left to rot and die and the leader of the free Adventists um was actually
37:52
sentenced in 1978 I think um uh and he was sentenced he was about 75 years old
38:00
um and he was sentenced to a hard labor camp in in Siberia um the United Nations
38:05
protested to the Soviet Union for his release um so nson protested for his release um many International Figures
38:12
were not Adventists wrote to the Soviet poit Bureau begging for the release of the underground Church leader of the
38:17
Adventist Church and the Soviet poit Bureau ignored all their requests and that old man was sent off to a hard
38:22
labor camp in Siberia where he died within three months of the conditions that he was forced to endure but as my
38:28
wife says um truth stands the test of time and if today you are demonized by
38:36
Society do not give up hope because Society may change tomorrow the Crowds
38:41
Are fickle the crowds most of the crowd will follow the herd because few people want to stand out from the herd what
38:48
matters is the truth and knowing the truth and as Adventist the ultimate truth is Jesus Christ himself for
38:55
ourselves because when we listen to his voice through the word of God and through the conscience therefore we are best placed
39:02
to withstand the final deceptions that are coming Upon This World from Satan so knowing the truth knowing Jesus Christ
39:09
is becoming ever more important in a world of profound falsehood and lies the truth does matter you might say
39:17
that in the pandemic this passage from Isaiah 28: 14- 15 summarizes what happened to our
39:25
church Isaiah is speaking to the church leaders in Jerusalem he says therefore hear the word of the Lord you scornful
39:31
men who rule his people who are in Jerusalem because you have said we have made a covenant with death and with hell
39:37
we are at agreement when the overwhelming Scourge shall pass through it shall not come unto us why for we
39:44
have made lies our refuge and under falsehood have we hid ourselves it is a truth that the GC did
39:50
not follow the science they followed the lies they did not seek the truth they sought massive Federal pandemic funding
39:57
they did Not Bow before the convictions of the Holy Spirit upon the members consciences they bowed before the bullies of the mainstream media they did
40:03
not stand up for the convictions of our members where they demonized members by their official media online and in print
40:10
the net result of this is there's been a catastrophic collapse of confidence in the Public Health Community in general
40:17
in particular and with some medical practitioners and we have to rebuild that trust now because I want to trust
40:24
my doctor and number two there's a Prof found sense of betrayal of Anger of
40:29
alienation distrust and disillusionment among Adventists worldwide with our church leaders and to a lesser extent
40:36
with the entire Adventist hierarchy because during the pandemic while people may whisper their support in private in
40:43
public nobody in the hierarchy spoke up publicly for Liberty of conscience of their members
40:49
nobody it was a systemic failure of leadership loss or fear of job loss fear
40:56
of losing their career in the church hierarchy I think I kept many of our church leaders quiet this is the simple
41:02
truth I don't say this in anger please don't hear anger in my voice I love many of these church leaders they're my
41:08
brothers and sisters in Christ but the fact of the matter is this is not a good sign for the final
41:14
crisis when people are bought and they have those careers and they have those
41:19
positions often times they're bought and sold that career and they may they may
41:24
agree in private with you but in public they will never stand up for you one person said to me Conrad I agree with
41:30
what you preach when the Holy Spirit convicts me to say the same things I will speak up alongside you I said well
41:36
now would be nice but that never happened so what was the impact of this
41:43
statement because the truth matters the truth matters Adventists worldwide saw our
41:50
church leaders presume the rights to override the convictions of the Holy Spirit and the consciences of individual
41:55
members this is a Papal like Authority entirely foreign to the word of God
42:01
because of the hugely detrimental impact of that statement from 21 multitudes of members have lost any basic trust in the
42:08
general conference and have a legitimate sense of betrayal and abandonment it appears to many members today that our
42:15
hierarchy exists primarily for the financial benefit of the hierarchy and its functionaries through the
42:20
preservation of federal income streams to our us institutions and the concerns and consciences of members are no longer
42:26
of concern to senior administrators let me give you a simple case study that illustrates how this
42:32
played out in practice this is a true story I've seen the paperwork I've been following this story for three years
42:37
many people have written to me with their stories but this one really stands out and I have permission from the the
42:44
young man and his mother to tell the story tonight there is a young man in Australia Today he is a he was a 27
42:51
year-old teacher employed by a local conference in the Australian Union as a high school teacher he graduated from
42:57
college with an elementary education degree he had he had he graduated with some debts but by God's grace he found a
43:04
job as a high school teacher in an adven to school he purchased a home before the
43:09
pandemic arrived and he had a mortgage to pay he was a healthy young man taking much regular exercise to live the Adent
43:15
his health message he was a healthy young man then the pandemic came along and his
43:21
employer the local Adventist conference required him to take the shots he was
43:26
strongly opposed to this on grounds of Liberty of conscience and on medical grounds he had a history of problems
43:32
with vaccinations his Physicians suffered a Bonafide submitted a Bonafide
43:37
medical exemption request but that was denied by the educational administrator's self-appointed task
43:43
force after all avenues for receiving his waiver had been exhausted and believing he had no choice or he' lose
43:50
his career and be unable to pay his mortgage and be to care go homeless this young man succumbed to the pressure and
43:56
received the astroica vaccine shortly thereafter he had a massive stroke with an 18 mm blood clot
44:03
to his brain his neurologist and card cardiologist declared it to be idiopathic which means arising
44:09
spontaneously or from an unsure unknown cause as he was a physically fit en able
44:15
and active young man who adhered to the ab's health sty Health message and lifestyle almost two years later he
44:21
remains at home partially paralyzed unable to engage in work he has lost his
44:26
income he's lost his home his mother has resigned her nursing job to look after him 247 because he now needs nursing
44:34
care Around the Clock the Australian Union and his local conference have turned their backs on
44:41
him and his repeated requests for assistance I've read the paperwork I won't show it here but essentially
44:47
they've said we fulfilled our legal responsibilities you're on your own although they did say to him that if he
44:52
recovers from the the impact of this stroke of which the cause they they know know they do not know what the cause of
44:58
that stroke is they'll be happy to re-employ him as a teacher that's good and comforting news for him well
45:04
remember he took the astrazenica vaccine in 22 the astroica vaccine had already been banned in many countries
45:11
around the world because it caused his brain bleeds in Spring of 23 much of this young man's shugar in
45:17
the Australian government banned the Astro zenica shots Nationwide because they were determined to be linked with
45:23
brain bleeds and strokes as this man had experienced and finally in May 2024 Astro zenica withdrew their
45:31
vaccines worldwide after admitting in the UK Court the relationship between uh
45:36
with with brain bleeds and strokes that which was safe and effective officially that which was
45:42
mandated by our church administrators with calamitous effect was then banned
45:48
overnight by the Australian government precisely because it was not safe and effective so far the conference and the
45:54
israelian union have denied any and all respons responsibility for their part in this mess the structure sails on leaving
46:01
broken bodies destroyed lives and betrayed trust in its wake and nobody
46:07
seems to care but this is wrong this is profoundly wrong this is a human case
46:13
study of what happens when Church administrators overstep their boundaries and deny members the ability to follow
46:20
the dictates on the conscience of the Holy Spirit and the church just the hierarchy
46:26
just mov move sailes on as if nothing has happened leaving broken bodies and destroyed lives in its
46:32
wake this is what happens when our GC administrators make illegitimate decisions overstep their defined
46:39
boundaries of delegated authority and assume the right to trample on Liberty of conscience had that man's request for
46:46
a religious exemption been honored he would still be working today but his life has been destroyed by the actions
46:53
of those administrators personally probably this state the statement will get me into trouble I believe that every
47:00
General Conference administrator who has party to that reaffirmation statement should resign immediately because they
47:06
overstep their Authority with catastrophic impact on the lives of innocent Adventists worldwide I think they should resign
47:13
they no longer have our confidence so what are the implications
47:19
well it's difficult it's difficult to talk about this because had the general conference said with hindsight we
47:25
recognize we've made a mistake and therefore we want to we want to recognize we made a mistake want to apologize how can we make this better
47:31
and let's make sure we don't make these kind of mistakes again what is actually happened is the general conference issued a statement Define defending
47:38
their right to make such statements we discussed that last night and they have
47:44
basically um cancelled any and all possibility of any discussion about their authority to make that
47:50
statement after my appeal to having nobility sermon in January 2022 the GC issued a GL Global
47:57
condemnation in abage News Network of any who had question their authority to prevent any discussion at the 2022 GC
48:04
session the GC Adcom stripped me of my delegate status because they didn't want me to speak up and raise this question
48:09
from the floor when attorney zurl from California from L Linda made a motion to
48:15
add the vaccine statement to the GC agenda in 22 Elder Wilson squashed that motion from the front and you saw that
48:21
last night the liberty and Health Alliance put together a petition to the General Conference of administrators
48:28
almost 25,000 Adventists pastors doctors nurses members worldwide signed that petition and no response was ever given
48:35
to that petition when Pastor Wilson did a c question and answer with members at the Granite Bay church in February 23
48:42
over 1100 members were present and they were encouraged to type on their cell phones and type in a question and Elder
48:49
Wilson sat on the panel with a couple of other pastors like Pastor James rafy from 3abn and so forth and the number
48:55
one question because people could vote for it the number one question that was up on the screen the whole afternoon was why did the GC issue the reaffirmation
49:02
statement that hurt so many Adventists and for the entire afternoon the panel refused to take that question even
49:09
though it we had about 1150 votes out of the people present essentially our leaders are now
49:16
hiding behind their lawyers no discussion is possible but we need a process of forgiveness of reconciliation
49:23
and healing to begin and that requires courage on the part of all parties Jesus said blessed are the peacemakers
49:30
for they shall be called the children of God and it is incumbent I believe Upon Our GC leadership to recognize their
49:36
role in what has happened and to make the first step to reconciliation with the members who've been hurt by their
49:42
illegitimate actions so over the years I believe we have
49:50
morphed we began in the 1860s identifying as God's Endtime Remnant
49:55
movement in Prophecy as the remnant movement of Prophecy those who keep the Commandments of God
50:00
and have the testimony of Jesus as the end time Remnant people of God we were
50:06
fundamentally at odds with our wider environment the USA was the second beast
50:11
of Revelation 13 one of the Endtime foes of God's people but over the years we
50:17
have morphed less do we talk about Remnant church we become a respectable Church We
50:23
crave and receive tax exempt status Federal contract TRS for our colleges and our hospitals subsidies and
50:29
scholarships for our students no longer are we fundamentally at odds with our wider environment we' become
50:35
fundamentally at ease with our wider environment during the pandemic when
50:40
faced by huge social economic political and media pressure we morphed again we
50:46
didn't go back to becoming a Remnant church we ceased to be a respectable church we became a regime church we
50:52
propagated the official lies we canceled the truth speakers in our midst we demonized our members who would not bow
50:58
of lies and we chased Federal funding for our institutions it's not easy to talk like
51:05
this but this is the truth and for us to have healing in our church we have to speak the truth in love but we have to
51:12
speak the truth we became a regime Church um implementing the dictates of a
51:19
Godless government that has no place for God in it in its deliberations and we acted against our own members to
51:25
preserve our our Revenue stream our institutions this is nothing new in World War I the Advent Church in Germany
51:32
supported the KA vilhelm regime over biblical truth and the concerns of the members we encouraged our young people
51:38
to sign up to fight for the Kaiser and we encouraged our members to work in the ammunition factories including on the
51:43
Sabbath as a result of this the SDA Reform movement um was born in the USSR
51:49
the SDA Church supported the Communist demand for young Adventists to enter the Red Army in
51:54
1928 we changed in 19 20 we said that Adventists are conscientious objectives
51:59
to military service and in 1924 under pressure from Joseph Stalin's regime the
52:04
all Soviet SDA Congress we changed our position slightly so we said now it's up to individual conscience for our young
52:10
men whether they serve in the Red Army or not and in 1928 the position changed again after
52:16
further pressure from the Soviets and the all Soviet Adventist Congress voted um to support and recommend our young
52:22
men serving in the Red Army as a result of which the underground SD Church began and they were called the true and free
52:29
sta movement and they lasted almost 70 years as an underground Adventist movement faithful to the Lord until the
52:35
Soviet Union collapsed in the v in Vietnam to this day 2024 the communist
52:41
government expects CH school children to attend school on Sabbath mornings and there is in Vietnam today an official
52:47
Adventist Church who send their children to school on Sabbath morning and there is an underground Adventist Church many
52:52
times larger than the official church and they refuse to send their children school on the Sabbath mornings
52:59
historically when adventism faces totalitarian demands we have
53:05
split we have retained an official Adventist Church that has survived the regime we thank the Lord for that but
53:11
they have always yielded to the regime's unscriptural rules and they've sacrificed our members and beliefs in
53:17
order to save our institutions we have also had a split where an underground Adventist Church
53:23
comes into being in the same country and that Underground church is true to
53:28
scripture that's what has happened historically in adventism now time and again when those those regimes fall
53:36
there's a process of reconciliation that takes place and in some parts of the world that reconciliation is more
53:42
advanced than in other parts of the world but some of these divisions between those who bow to the
53:47
totalitarian demands and those who are faithful to scripture and who are demonized by the official Church some of
53:53
those divisions exist today around the world church we may not be familiar with that too much in Maine
53:59
but as one who travels the world I can tell you those divisions are still known by members who've gone through the trauma of a totalitarian regime and I
54:07
would say this uh at this moment here don't think for a minute that you know which group you would be in and
54:13
totalitarian demands come your way nobody really knows how they're going to respond to a matter of life and
54:20
death nobody really knows how you would respond to the threat of a bullet from the KGB or the or the um the gustara
54:28
nobody really knows so as we look back on this history rather than saying this group is bad or this group is wrong or
54:35
this group is good we say thank you Lord that I was not forced to make that decision myself and by the
54:55
grace and so um P post PTSD years and years after these events took place but
55:01
we why am I talking about this again tonight because as I said last night we are facing new totalitarian demands
55:09
affecting all of humanity the who is actively seeking via the international Health regulations the authority to
55:16
declare actual or potential pandemics to issue mandates override and and um
55:21
override all civil and human rights and to mandate vaccines globally that's what they openly and actively seeking for and
55:29
once they get it once they will never get give up that Authority we are entering a techno dictatorship a
55:34
dictatorship of technocrats the climate change industry is also seeking climate
55:40
change lockdowns to be held on Sundays to reserve our common planetary home
55:45
disease x empo uh Aven flu mandates and vaccines
55:51
these are all in our future these are all being openly discussed by our political Elites
55:56
and it won't even be a surprise to you that the papacy actively supports the climate
56:02
change lockdowns and the vaccination lock lockdowns they support all of those
56:07
lockdowns not because they're particularly interested in your well-being but because these initiatives cement a globalized technocratic
56:14
dictatorship over all of humanity they allow societies to accept the fact that
56:20
you can override the convictions of the Holy Spirit on the consciences of individuals once we accept want as in
56:26
the last four years that you can override your conscience and it's easier for people to accept that in the next Crisis the pacy supports these
56:33
initiatives because they help to usher in the final crisis of conscience and false worship that will precede the
56:39
second coming now when it comes to the climate change issue the GC Adcom did Issue a statement
56:46
in December 95 called the the dangers of climate change it's an official statement I wish they wouldn't issue
56:53
these official statements because they don't age very well and this is what they voted it says the SDA Church officially requested all
57:01
World governments to quote take steps necessary to averts the danger quote by
57:06
fulfilling the agreement reached in Rio to Janeiro the 1992 convention on climate change to stabilize carbon
57:12
dioxide emissions by the year 2000 at 1990 levels and by establishing plans
57:17
for further reductions in carbon dioxide emissions after the year 2000 that last
57:22
sentence is an open check to the world governments to do what they want for climate change as far as our church is
57:28
concerned we have already signed up to whatever climate change inies are going to come our way
57:35
therefore it is not surprising that if you just change the word vaccination for climate
57:41
change that statement could be issued in the future which says the general conference is convinced that not
57:47
vaccination but climate change programs have been carried out are important for safety and health our members in larger
57:52
Community therefore claims of religious liberty are not used appropiately objecting to government mandates or employee programs designed to protect
57:59
the health and safety of their communities once you've signed up an open ended check to the world
58:05
governments to implement whatever they want to do to restrict climate change this is not a far it's not Beyond
58:10
imagination Beyond Reason to expect this kind of statement to be issued once again and once again our consciences to
58:17
be trampled upon so as I look at we look at the the the
58:24
the the a what has happened in the last four years as I travel around the world
58:30
I see that we are facing potential splits along two lines in our church it's it's come to the United
58:36
methodists it's come to the lutherans it's come to the Presbyterians it's come to the episcopalians and it's coming our
58:42
way as well on the one side there will be Adventists who reject the GC adcoms assumed authority over their conscience
58:50
who hold true to scripture and our fundamental beliefs and who thus who reject the onrush of cultural Marxism
58:55
and s in tions among our leaders professors and pastors and it's more widespread than we like to admit then
59:02
there'll be Adventists who accept the GC adcoms assumed authority over their individual conscience neither afraid to
59:08
contend for the F the faith passed onto us as for Jude verse three will actually support the abandonment of scripture in
59:14
favor of cultural Marxism and you'll notice there's a remarkable correlation between those who uphold the mandates
59:21
and attack others who don't take the shots and those who support critical race Theory critical gender the lgbtq
59:27
normalization within our church Etc there's a remarkable parallel between people who take one position and the
59:33
other so you might say as I look at what's coming upon our church that we're
59:40
going to have to make a choice each and every one of us the church when we talk about the
59:45
church we often mean the legal hierarchy like the Norther New England conference and the Atlantic Union North America
59:50
division the general conference when we talk about the church as members that's often what we mean but the truth of the
59:56
matter is if the government of Maine were to cancel the registration the legal registration of Northern New
1:00:01
England conference does that mean the Adventist Church would cease to exist in Maine yes or no absolutely not it means
1:00:08
simply a functional unit that we where we turn our ties and offerings to to support pastors and Educators so forth
1:00:14
that no longer exists but the body of Christ still exists it simply becomes an underground Church which means it has no
1:00:21
legal presence so what I see happening as a result of the last four years
1:00:27
and the onrush of cultural Marxism across our institutions is this that we are going to have groups of faithful and
1:00:33
convicted Adventists on the one side and we're going to have institutional and cultural Adventists on the other side
1:00:40
there are many of them are Adventists by convenience rather than by conviction the Adventists on the left are
1:00:46
independent of federal funding the Adventists on the right particularly our institutions are completely dependent on
1:00:51
federal funding for institutions to remain alive the Adventist on the left the faithful and convicted Adventists
1:00:58
they uphold Liberty of conscience the cultural or institutional Adventists feel free to trample on Liberty of
1:01:03
conscience when never financially or socially expedient the Adventists on the left the faithful and convicted
1:01:09
Adventists will one day establish when the mark of the beast is imposed an underground network of layed house
1:01:14
churches that's what we're going to be before Jesus comes again the Adventists on the right the institutional
1:01:20
Adventists will remain in a visible network of conference Affiliated churches and Conference owned buildings
1:01:26
the advid on the left the faithful Adventists will be able to preach and live the Everlasting gospel and Bible
1:01:32
truth freely because they have no no fear of loss of having their Church taken away from them by the conference
1:01:37
or the government the institutional Adventists they increasingly self censor the preaching of Bible truths if they
1:01:44
happen to rebuke cultural Marxism we see this in Canada today where pastors are
1:01:50
self-censoring in the area of human sexuality and marriage pastors dare not preach out biblical truth in Canada
1:01:56
today even many Adventist pastors because if they do the church WIll face a lot of hostile attacks from the
1:02:02
Canadian federal government so it seems to me that in Canada we should already be going to an underground Church in
1:02:08
order to live and preach gospel truth freely and openly we on the left we have
1:02:13
faithful and convicted Adventists who reject the acceptance of lgbtq ideology and the normalization of this lifestyle
1:02:20
within our church the reposturing that some conferences want and on the right we have Institution Adventists who are
1:02:27
increasingly accepting lgbtq ideology and the normalization of this lifestyle you might say they're no longer seven
1:02:33
Adventists they are sodomite Adventists on the left hand you got the faithful Adventists they are focused on bringing
1:02:40
the Everlasting gospel to Every Nation tribe language and people on the right we have our institutional Adventists who
1:02:46
are focused on the preservation of our institutions of our retirement funds of the visible hierarchy and administrative
1:02:52
incomes on the left the faithful Adventists they seek the eternal spiritual benefit of individual members
1:02:57
and non-members no matter the cost on the right the institutional Adventist they seek the temporal that is the the
1:03:04
Earthly Financial survival of our hierarchy and our institutions no matter the cost now you may say past that's a
1:03:11
very harsh division but this is what I'm seeing happening around us it may not be popular to say this but
1:03:18
this is what is happening and in every one of our institutions that are supposed to be bastions of the Adventist
1:03:25
faith increasingly they are Battlegrounds of the Adventist Faith where those who are upholding biblical
1:03:30
truth are fighting a losing rear guard action against the onslaught of cultural Marxism within our institutions this is
1:03:37
the reality and this is affecting pastors and Educators across particularly the North American Division
1:03:44
so this is how I see this is this is where we may be going here in the North American division is very similar to the
1:03:50
split that's taken place in the United Methodist Church where you have the Bible faithful methodists have formed
1:03:55
new nomination the global Methodist conference that is affiliated with the Southern Hemisphere methodists and the
1:04:02
remainder of the United Methodist Church in North America have now become essentially a woke ideological um
1:04:09
Talking Shop and they'll probably go bankrupt in the next couple of years because their tithe base has collapsed
1:04:15
and so this is that the the pandemic merely revealed and exposed
1:04:21
where each of our hearts are they revealed whether we are willing to live according to our conscience and face
1:04:27
loss because we believe in truth and they revealed whether we are willing to accept the right to mandate on other
1:04:33
people actions which go against their conscience or not and I'm not pointing the finger at anybody here tonight but I
1:04:40
am asking each one of us today to take a look at yourself in the mirror tonight and ask where we were in the
1:04:45
pandemic now and given what we now know about the official narrative that it was almost all a pack of lies and it was
1:04:52
known to be a pack of Lies by those propagating it amazing maybe it's a call for humility on each of our paths and a
1:04:59
recognition that um God help us next time this kind of nonsense comes around
1:05:04
and that we're in this together as brothers and sisters and whatever the divisions and pains of the past have
1:05:10
been let us work together with our brothers and sisters and say look the pandemic is over and I can forgive you
1:05:16
if you and please would you forgive me and if I contribute if I contribut to it please forgive me and vice versa because
1:05:22
we are more strong we are stronger and we are more successful Mission when we are united together and so we need to
1:05:29
think of ways of how we come together and recognize the harms that were caused when people acted on the basis of
1:05:35
falsehood against one another the truth really does matter
1:05:40
the so what do we do as Adventists well this slide
1:05:46
here is a slide that will probably get me into more trouble but I put it up
1:05:51
[Music] there so the first thing is what can we we do as Bible faithful Adventist day
1:05:57
and the first thing I would say is one option you have is do nothing and recognize that the next time
1:06:04
mandates come along you're probably going to be thrown under the bus once again and your livelihood your career
1:06:11
your job your mortgage your home your business your marriage your your custody battles will all be sacrificed by our
1:06:16
leaders to reserve their institutions incomes and status that is not an option for any of us here
1:06:22
tonight the second option we have and I would encourage you to do this is to actively pray for our church leaders
1:06:30
start praying for Elder Wilson as I said last night and the night before Elder Wilson is a champion for mission in our
1:06:37
church I believe his heart really is in the right place but it's hard for one man to do something against the sheer
1:06:43
inertia of all bad divisions around the world pray for our world leaders that they will find the courage no matter
1:06:49
what the mainstream media May pressure them to do to uphold Liberty of conscience and to contend for the faith
1:06:56
that has been passed on to us you know Jude's chapter Jude is only one
1:07:02
chapter in it the third verse Jude chapter 1 there's only one
1:07:08
chapter Jude chapter 1 verse3 says this beloved while eagerly preparing to write
1:07:13
to you about the salvation we share I find it necessary to write and appeal to you to contend for the faith that was
1:07:20
once for all entrusted to the Saints so we are to contend for the faith if we do
1:07:26
not contend for the faith the faith will be overwhelmed by falsehoods and so when particularly when
1:07:31
it comes to our church leaders um when we elect church leaders they work in conferences and unions and divisions we
1:07:38
do not pay them to go and do their job and go go to their desk write a few emails sit in a few meetings watch the
1:07:43
trends that are happening and feel bad about what is happening but say nothing in the Committees then go home and
1:07:49
Grumble to their spouse about what is happening we don't pay our leaders to do that we pay our leaders as far as I'm
1:07:55
concerned the tithes that we return and I'm thankful we have leaders who do do this we we return our tithes so that our
1:08:01
leaders in their sphere of influence on the Committees where they sit when appointment decisions are being made
1:08:07
when budgets are being allocated when when ethical and philosophical decisions are being made in the conference I'm
1:08:13
hoping and praying that our leaders will contend for the faith that has been passed on to them as well that they will
1:08:18
fight and defend the faith that we have not just that we have as members but our leaders will fight for and contend for
1:08:24
the faith in their sphere of influence it is not enough just to go to your office and come home after 40 hours and
1:08:30
Grumble to your spouse you're in that office for a reason who knows that you've come to the kingdom for such a
1:08:35
time as this and I thank the Lord for every leader who does stand up for what is right and true and proper I would
1:08:41
encourage you to pray for our leaders pray for your conference president here pray for your union president that they
1:08:46
will have the courage when those hidden moments when decisions are being made that nobody sees and there's a lot on
1:08:52
the line that they will have the courage to do the right thing pray for your leaders because they have
1:08:57
impossible tasks and when they know that people are praying for them gives them courage and it puts wind in the sales of
1:09:03
that ship of state so the ship is going in the right direction so pray for your church leaders the third point there is
1:09:10
more contentious and put there if the GC supports future mandates over the
1:09:16
consciences of members that's an important caveat if the GC in the future supports
1:09:22
future mandates over the consciences of mandates I think we are well within our rights to establish a par Church
1:09:27
movement within the Adventist Church and what is that a par Church movement would
1:09:32
be a gathering of l l lay Conference of Ley they gather they maybe incorporate
1:09:38
they return their tithes that new L entity that covers the whole of North American Division and then the committee
1:09:43
allocates that tithe to conferences who are faithful to scripture and that way the conferences
1:09:49
that go woke will go broke very simple and the members will determine where
1:09:55
that tithe goes based on Fidelity to scripture and whether they are willing to contend for the faith that has been passed on to us I recognize this is uh
1:10:04
when you touch the question of tithe this is this this is the the sacred nerve in the Adventist
1:10:10
Church but Elder Wilson did say in his first sermon hold your leaders to account so we're going to hold our
1:10:16
leaders to account and if if more mandates are imposed that override your conscience
1:10:22
and the church throws us under the bus once again I I believe that someone somewhere will take the first steps to
1:10:28
establish a parachurch movement and we'll say with modern Banking and modern legal systems we don't need the
1:10:34
conference Union division GC hierarchy we can collect the tithes ourselves and allocate them to the conferences at a
1:10:40
faithful descript it's a revolutionary idea it's kind of Crossing the Rubicon
1:10:45
from many administrators perspective but it's what we can do as members because
1:10:51
we were encouraged to hold our leaders to account by our current GC president when he was elected and this is about the only way we can do
1:10:58
it so this may well happen if the GC supports future mandates over the consciences of
1:11:04
members and the fourth thing we're not there yet is migrate to an underground
1:11:09
house Church movement led by bivocational elders and pastors that's where we're going to be
1:11:16
when the mark of the beast is imposed when the mark of the beast is imposed the conferences cannot bank
1:11:22
because they won't receive the mark of the beast if they're if they're faith to scripture that means the conferences cannot employ pastors they cannot employ
1:11:29
teachers they cannot receive tithes and offerings therefore the conferences when the mark of the beast is imposed are basically history so when the mark of
1:11:36
the beast is imposed we will be in underground house Church movements led by bivocational Elders who are elders
1:11:43
and pastors of the same things in the New Testament but we're not there yet in
1:11:48
time the mark of the beast is not here yet we are stronger as a movement and
1:11:53
more effective in reaching unre preached when we work together so therefore I would appeal tonight as I've appealed before to the
1:12:00
church leaders to that this annual Council this October I know many of the church
1:12:06
leaders will see this sermon many of you know that what happened was a profound
1:12:11
mistake so may the Holy Spirit give you the courage to resend and apologize for the 2021 reaffirmation statement it has
1:12:19
been exposed to be a pack of Lies you took shelter in lies now you can stand
1:12:24
for the truth truth I want to appeal to our GC leaders to establish a fund to compensate Adventists who lost their
1:12:30
livelihoods like that young man in Australia who suffered catastrophic physical damage from the vaccines they
1:12:36
were forced to take because of the reaffirmation statement it just adds insult to injury that that which was
1:12:41
mandated in 22 was banned by the Australian government because of those problems it's ridiculous it's truly
1:12:51
ridiculous so I want I'd like to appeal to the GC to public L affirm that in the future they will defend the good
1:12:58
conscience decisions of all Adventists visy any and all future vaccination
1:13:03
mandates if we do that the whole world will hear about the Adventist Church because we'll be the only
1:13:10
Protestant denomination that stands for Liberty of conscience when the next set of mandates come out and the Book of
1:13:16
Revelation and the Three Angels messages fear God and give glory to him those messages are given in the context of of
1:13:22
the mandates of the mark of the beast because the third angels messages do not receive the mark of the beast so the
1:13:28
Three Angels messages presuppose that you and I and planet Earth everybody still has in that final crisis at least
1:13:34
some Liberty of conscience to respond in faith to God no matter what the beasts of this world might do to them so
1:13:40
therefore if we want to be known as the church the movement that Champions
1:13:46
Liberty of conscience we can start today by affirming that we will uphold the conscience of our members Vis any future
1:13:53
vaccination mandates and finally to rehire any Adventists who were fired by the denomination um for living in
1:13:59
accordance with the convictions of the Holy Spirit as I was thinking about this I added another
1:14:07
appeal this is um there's a lot of text on the screen there but let me just share I'm saying
1:14:14
the US federal government is turning its back on God as you turn away from God you turn to Satan and his control so the
1:14:21
US federal government is turning now to its end time role as a war makinging persecuting conscience denying second
1:14:29
beast of Revelation 13 we can see the second beast coming into effect before our very eyes even as we speak this year
1:14:36
2024 satanic policies are being imposed by the federal government as an example
1:14:42
the new title N9 rules on gender identity for affecting all the colleges in America now the Adventist Church
1:14:48
cannot be a prophetic voice that God has raised her to be while she is financially dependent on the second
1:14:53
beast of Revelation 13 therefore if we are to be the prophetic voice at the end of time I would appeal
1:15:01
to the the Wilson Administration to add to the agenda of the 25th session the question of divesting all institutions
1:15:08
that receive federal funding uh from the SDA Church sooner or later as we heard in
1:15:14
our Q&A today sooner or later we have to get off that Federal train sooner or later if we don't get
1:15:21
off that Federal train then the the financial Ties That Federal train will mean that our institutions will
1:15:27
persecute our members when the mark of the beast is imposed so we have been blessed over the years by our
1:15:33
partnership with with Medicaid and Medicare and and all the rest of it but that was when we had more of an
1:15:38
ideologically benign government we no longer have ideologically benign governments we have ideologically driven
1:15:44
Federal governments and sooner or later this question has to come to the for the
1:15:50
pandemic is a great Catalyst for raising this question sooner or later we have to
1:15:55
get off that Federal train or we're going to implement Federal mandates all the way through to the mark of the
1:16:01
beast so I've spoken a lot about other people
1:16:07
here this is my favorite quote from the spirit of Prophecy I I I have it printed out in the front of my Bible
1:16:13
here many of you are very familiar with it the greatest want of the world is the
1:16:18
want of men men who will not be bought or sold men who in their innermost souls
1:16:23
are true and honest men who do not fear to call Sin By Its Right name men whose
1:16:29
conscience is as true to duty as the needle to the pole men who will stand for the right so the heavens
1:16:35
fall the quote goes on but such a character is not the result of accident
1:16:41
it is not due to special favors or endowments of Providence a noble character is the result of
1:16:47
self-discipline of the subjection of the lower to the higher nature the surrender of self for the service of love to God
1:16:54
and man but the quote goes on this quote is from
1:16:59
the book education it is given under the prophetic inspiration for young people
1:17:05
not just old preachers like me the want the greatest want of the world is the want of certain kinds of
1:17:10
men and women will not be bought or sold this is a message for teenagers today for young people it's in the book
1:17:17
education it's not in the book councils to ministers it's in the book education so sister white goes on to say the youth
1:17:24
need to be improved with the truth that their endowments are not their own strength time intellect are but lent
1:17:31
Treasures they belong to God and it should be the resolve of every youth to put them to the highest use he is a
1:17:38
branch from which God expects fruit a steward whose capital must yield increase a light to illuminate the
1:17:44
world's Darkness every youth every child has a work to do for the honor of God
1:17:50
and the uplifting of humanity so this is the counsel we've been given given and if you're a young
1:17:55
person sitting here tonight don't think that people such as Abraham Lincoln or
1:18:01
Martin Luther King they didn't appear overnight a um Elijah and and Moses did
1:18:07
not appear overnight God shapes and fashion you in your your younger years because he knows
1:18:14
the moment when you are coming into the kingdom for such a time as this he knows the moment when you are going to be the
1:18:19
tip of the spear for the kingdom of God he knows the moment when you're going to be called to answer for the faith that
1:18:25
you have within your heart and your mind and he knows when you're going to have to contend for the faith despite the opposition of all around
1:18:31
you and so i' encourage you as young people those young people watching online the character that we read about
1:18:40
here the greatest one to the world is the want of men and women will not be bought or sold etc etc who will stand
1:18:46
for the right that the heavens fall you can have that character by the grace of God as well it is not the result of
1:18:53
accident it comes through self-discipline or the subjection of the lower to the higher nature the
1:19:00
subjection of our physical desires and and our fallen desires and and our carnal nature for for the for the the
1:19:07
overriding rule of reason and conscience in our lives the surrender of self for
1:19:13
for the service of love to God and to man it's my prayer that each one of
1:19:20
us will cooperate with the Holy Spirit from this day forward amen we will
1:19:26
cooperate with the Holy Spirit and he will bring to completion the good work that he's begun in each one of us so
1:19:31
when that final crisis comes you and I will be found in this group here men and women who will stand for the right
1:19:38
though the heavens fall men and women whose conscience is as true to duty as the needle is to the pole men and women
1:19:44
who do not fear to call Sin By Its Right name who in their innermost souls are true and honest cooperate with God be s
1:19:54
to the leading of the Holy Spirit be obedient to the promptings of the spirit in your in his word and in his in upon
1:20:01
your conscience and God will develop a character in you that is Fit For Eternity let's bow our heads and close
1:20:07
with a word of prayer heavenly
1:20:12
father I thank you that you allow us to go through these troubles I thank you Lord that no
1:20:19
trouble has come upon us but you give us the grace to get through it I thank you Lord that when you allow
1:20:25
troubles to come our way it's a vote of confidence like you've got this and Lord we've all got War Stories
1:20:31
what's happened in our past but father I pray that in these
1:20:38
days of camp meeting the coming weeks and months that you will so refine and
1:20:44
shape our characters that we will be heroes of faith in Earth's Final
1:20:50
hours father I pray that we will put away the gods of this world
1:20:55
I pray that we will wash our minds every morning through the water of the word of God I pray that we will receive the
1:21:01
baptism of the Holy Spirit we will ask for it and receive it each and every morning I pray Lord that when that final
1:21:08
Crist crisis comes knocking on our doors we will be ready for that moment
1:21:14
