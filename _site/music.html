      <h1 id="my-music">My music</h1>

<p>I began piano and violin lessons at age 12 and studied for about five years. During and since that time I have worked as a church pianist and have played at various events. During my time in the Philippines, the dearth of pianos prompted me to take up guitar, which I now play for fun and occasionally in public. While not a prolific composer, I have written a few songs over the years, a selection of which appear on this page. Feel free to download, use, and share anything on this page.</p>

<h2 id="the-rest-that-remains">“The Rest That Remains”</h2>

<p>A hymn based on the message of Hebrews 3 and 4. <a href="/assets/files/music/the_rest_that_remains.pdf">Download PDF</a></p>

<h2 id="hark-the-herald-angels-singcnc-performance">“Hark! The Herald Angels Sing”—CNC Performance</h2>

<p>A 3-axis CNC machine is also a potential 3-voice choir. I wrote a Python script to convert musicxml files into machine code. The first verse in the video is adapted from a hymnal arrangement, and the second verse is an original arrangement I wrote to better showcase the machine’s polyphonic capabilities.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mlh2nd/musicxml-to-cnc">See the Python code on GitHub</a> (may require machine-specific tweaking).</p>

<video src="/assets/files/music/hark_on_cnc.mp4" height="400" controls=""></video>

<h2 id="i-love-you-always">“I Love You Always”</h2>

<p>A song I wrote for Natasha while we were dating. <a href="/assets/files/music/i_love_you_always.pdf">Download PDF</a></p>

<h2 id="imitators-ephesians-512-esv">“Imitators” (Ephesians 5:1–2, ESV)</h2>

<p>This scripture song is designed to be sung as a round to reinforce the theme of “imitation” found in the text. <a href="/assets/files/music/therefore_be_imitators.pdf">Download PDF</a></p>

<h2 id="weep-as-he-wept">“Weep as He Wept”</h2>

<p>I wrote this song in response to the following quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We must be co-workers with Christ if we would see our efforts crowned with success. We must weep as He wept for those who will not weep for themselves, and plead as He pleaded for those who will not plead for themselves.</p>

  <p>(Ellen White, Manuscript 24, 1903)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="psalm-117-kjv">Psalm 117, KJV</h2>

<p>I composed several Scripture songs during my teen years. This is one of them, which I more recently wrote down in four-part harmony. <a href="/assets/files/music/psalm_117.pdf">Download PDF</a></p>

<h2 id="go-to-the-ant-proverbs-6611-kjv">“Go to the Ant” (Proverbs 6:6–11, KJV)</h2>

<p>Another early Scripture song, composed when I was probably about 15 or 16. <a href="/assets/files/music/go_to_the_ant.pdf">Download PDF</a></p>
