_This paragraph comes from Dietrich Bonhoeffer's essay "After Ten Years: A Reckoning Made at New Year 1943". It is well worthy of reflection as we consider what kind of people we should be in the coming crisis, and the temptations often faced by those weary of fighting against evil._

We have been silent witnesses of evil deeds; we have been drenched by many storms; we have learned the arts of equivocation and pretense; experience has made us suspicious of others and kept us from being truthful and open; intolerable conflicts have worn us down and even made us cynical. Are we still of any use? What we shall need is not geniuses, or cynics, or misanthropes, or clever tacticians, but plain, honest, straightforward men. Will our inward power of resistance be strong enough, and our honesty with ourselves remorseless enough, for us to find our way back to simplicity and straightforwardness?
