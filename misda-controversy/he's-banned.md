“He's banned,” they said,  
“For he spoke against the church.”  
Confused, I clicked and read,  
And my stomach gave a lurch.   
As time wore on, opinions flew,  
Each person voicing their own point of view.   
Thus, often have I fallen to pray;  
For in sharing the truth, to ban is not the way.   
For even if he were not in the right,  
He is not an enemy that we need to fight.   
A pillar of the work, true warrior for Christ,  
Yes, with different views;  
But to drive him away, we would a precious brother lose.  
“Come now, let us reason together.”  
Come, questioning sister. Come doubting brother.   
Let words be gentle, soft, yet clear.   
As children of the Holy Lord, let us all come near.   
Let us each be humble, together seek the truth,  
Filled with the Holy Spirit, consider all the views.   
On both sides stand many great men,  
But in God's word alone is based my religion.   
Human views are often flawed and broken;  
But led by God's Spirit, the truth will always be spoken.
