YouTube's autogenerated transcript of Mark Howard's video

hi I'm Mark Howard a pastor in the Michigan Conference of 7th Day Adventists and if you're watching this video more than likely you are at least
0:07
a little bit aware of recent happenings in Michigan most notably the placing of one of their more well-known pastors on
0:13
an administrative leave uh this has given rise to a lot of discussion online and uh as one who has had more of a
0:20
firsthand account in some of these things I felt that it might be helpful for me to put this video out to give
0:26
some clarity shine a little bit of light in areas that uh maybe were not as clearly perceived before now this is
0:32
just my personal response this is not an official response of the Michigan conference which I'll touch on in a minute um but the question I'm posing is
0:40
is the Michigan conference now an apostasy that's what we're going to be looking at in this video now I have to
0:46
say that uh I typically do not when I present or preach I don't do a lot of
0:52
reading I'm going to be doing more reading in this particular presentation just for sake of clarity and brevity
0:57
I've written some things out and so I hope hope that is not too much of a distraction for you if it is I apologize
1:03
in advance uh you could just listen to the audio and uh maybe speed it up and
1:09
it would be more engaging I don't know uh I need to also say that I have never made claim to verbal inspiration that
1:16
means that I don't say everything just right and I would encourage you to show
1:22
mercy and uh follow the admonition of the scripture that says not to make a
1:28
man an offender for a word now having said those things uh I want to dive into this topic uh again social media
1:36
platforms have exploded almost any anything and everything I read from people I know has to do with the
1:42
Michigan conference and this recent decision um online commentators have been quick to pass judgment on the
1:48
conference as being authoritarian and overreaching the conference president has been pictured as a sort of dictator
1:54
who requires his employees to Parrot his ideas or face the consequences the conference executive
2:00
committee that made the decision has been portrayed as a group of mindless ideological drones who just do what the President says who can't think or act
2:08
for themselves and the pastors or other conference employees involved in the situation myself included are portrayed
2:14
as spineless cowards who fear to speak or act against the demands of conference Administration for fear of losing their
2:20
jobs um none of these things are accurate and so I as I said I want to
2:26
hopefully bring a little bit of clarity to the issue before diving into the message I just
2:32
want to clarify a few things as I stated this is not an official response of the Michigan conference uh I am not a an
2:40
administrator in the conference I am not in the ministerial Department I am not a part of the executive committee these
2:46
thoughts that I express here in this video are mine if the conference
2:52
officers or the exe executive committee members or anyone else at the conference were to give reasons for why they did
3:00
what they did they may be very different from the reasons that seem evident to me and so again I am only speaking for
3:06
myself in this video and while most of the viewers probably know the names of
3:12
the church involved in the situation it's senior pastor and the Elder that
3:18
has gained some notoriety of late I will not be using their names in this video
3:23
rather I will be referring to them as the church in question the pastor in question the Elder in question or
3:29
something along those lines there are details I'm aware of that other people
3:35
aren't aware of some of those details involve uh personal things uh they're
3:41
confidential and I will not be sharing those uh some of the things that I have experienced are in meetings where the
3:48
proceedings are confidential and I will not be sharing those things either U the pastor in question is a personal friend
3:55
of mine he's a brother in the faith he's a brother in Christ he's a colleague and
4:02
it pains my heart to the depths to say the least that this situation is even
4:07
happening um and I still hope and pray for better things
4:13
for this pastor now the way the Situation's been portrayed online
4:19
actually I found summarized pretty well in an article that I read it cited the American covid response that is the
4:25
response of our nation the United States of America to the co Pand pmic uh that
4:31
response in our country was viewed as and I quote a slew of government overreaches human rights abuses mandates
4:40
and coercion of conscience by power hungry officials all trying to out Nanny
4:45
State each other uh the article goes on to say basically that the world 7th Day
4:51
Adventist Church pitched their tent towards Big Pharma so the implication is
4:58
that the church compromised during the co pandemic for whatever
5:04
reason there a number of reasons that are conjectured online but while the
5:10
church at large was portrayed as caving and compromising there was one bright
5:15
light in Southern Michigan according to the online perspective a church that stood up for the rights of the
5:22
unvaccinated unfortunately the Michigan conference leadership in a vendetta against the light of Liberty of
5:28
conscience attempted to silence or cancel this church for its outspokenness
5:34
first Banning one of its Elders from speaking and ultimately placing the brave Pastor on administrative leave so
5:41
the mindset is during this crisis when the World Church was caving and
5:46
compromising there was this church the church in question that was faithful the
5:52
pastor in question the eldering question they stood up for the right while the conference that they were in Coward and
5:59
en caved and their actions were were were prompted by compromise and so the
6:08
title of this message is the Michigan conference now an apostasy have its leaders forsaken the
6:14
right way and gone the way of Baal or of Babylon has its leadership has this
6:21
conference so cowered and compromised that it can no longer be trusted by its constituents if you're a member in the
6:27
Michigan conference are you now to start considering moving away to some place
6:32
where they're faithful I want to tell you first of all the Michigan conference has been
6:39
known as being a conference that has stayed faithful to aous Doctrine
6:46
administ lifestyle and what have you is it possible that during the pandemic all
6:52
of a sudden everybody in the conference leadership suddenly flipped to
6:58
compromise and unfaithfulness except for two guys down
7:03
south put that tuck that away for a minute I want to tell you that from my
7:12
perspective true to its long-standing reputation I believe a clear and compelling case can be made for the
7:18
continuing faithfulness of the Michigan conference and it didn't have as much to
7:24
do with the covid response as people think now first of all I want to say I sympathize with those who have concerns
7:31
about the covid vaccine I have concerns about the covid vaccine my wife and I for the record are not anti-vaccination
7:39
but we were very careful with the vaccinations our children received and the timing of them and which ones they
7:45
received we did not follow the standardized schedule um as far as the
7:50
covid vaccine goes neither my wife nor myself received the vaccination we were
7:55
both working for the Michigan conference at the time uh my wife worked at the Great Lakes 7 Day adven Academy as the
8:02
food service director and I was working in the Sabbath School Ministry Sabbath school and personal Ministries Department as the associate neither of
8:09
us were pressured by the conference to receive the vaccine in fact there was next to no talk about the vaccine in our
8:16
office some people were vaccinated others weren't vaccinated nobody knows who's who because there wasn't it wasn't
8:22
asked it wasn't required there was no pressure on that our our office in Michigan our conference office
8:27
maintained a neutral position throughout the pandemic furthermore I agree that there needs to be more
8:34
conversation regarding vaccines the church's official position on vaccines
8:40
uh the covid response to vaccines I don't want to seem or come across as dismissive of people's concerns
8:46
regarding those issues however I have to say concerning this recent situation that it is crystal
8:52
clear to me from my firsthand experience that none of those issues were what prompted the decisions and and the
8:59
actions of the Michigan conference uh as I said they took a neutral position during the entire pandemic why after the
9:06
pandemic would all of a sudden they want to take a hard stance that's not what happened the issues or the concerns as I
9:12
see them were more along the lines of of professional and doctrinal and I will
9:19
let the conference speak to professional issues as they deem necessary in the
9:25
future I am going to address the doctrinal concerns that I have had and
9:30
still have concerning this issue over the past couple of years at least sentiments have been expressed regarding
9:37
the diversion of tithe funds as a corrective that means you choose to pay
9:43
or withhold or divert tithes to correct things you see in the church and I'll
9:48
touch on why I'm concerned about that in a moment tithe funds as a corrective the
9:54
role of the remnant as not pertaining to the 7th Day Adventist organized denomination
10:00
and an undermining of church Authority and organization contrary to all of
10:06
these contrary to the fundamental beliefs of 7 Adventist incidentally these sentiments can still be viewed in
10:12
sermons posted online I have put a link you'll see a link right there on the screen where you can access a document
10:20
and you can go uh there are links in the document that will take you right to the places in the video where videos there's
10:27
a number of them where these things are stated and you can go back and look at it in context so if there's a fear that
10:33
I'm quoting it out of context or somebody's quoting out of just watch it and it's the positions are stated clear
10:40
enough to know what the intent is in one controversial
10:46
presentation the Elder in question proposed a solution in the event that the GC would repeat the course of action
10:52
it followed from the recent pandemic and he said and I'm quoting if the GC supports future mandates over the
10:58
consciences of me MERS I think we are well within our rights to establish a parachurch movement within the Adventist
11:05
Church now some have argued that when he says a par Church movement parah means
11:11
beside and it's beside the church they're putting their arms around the church they're in harmony with the church but if you listen to the
11:17
description in the sermon this par Church movement would be a lay Le group within the organization that would not
11:24
be answerable to organizational leadership which how are you you even within the
11:30
organization if you're not answering to the organization you're clearly not within the organization so the concept
11:37
of well goes on to say uh in describing such a movement He suggests that they would return their tithes to a newly
11:43
established committee within this par Church movement who would then forward the ties to conferences they decided are
11:49
faithful that way he said conferences that go woke will go broke so very
11:54
clearly our little group is going to decide whether we're going to be returning tithes or not we're going to use that as a corrective so if we see
12:00
something going on that we don't agree with we're going to cancel it by withholding our ties and then we'll put
12:06
them wherever we want uh this expression these ideas reveal an egregious
12:14
misunderstanding of our doctrinal positions both concerning the tithe and also the remnant which I'm not now going
12:21
to address in that order let's start with the use of the tithe or the misuse
12:26
of the tithe scriptures clear that all the tithe of the land is the Lord's it
12:32
is Holy to the Lord in Leviticus 27:30 that means it does not belong to us but
12:38
God therefore it's not up to us to say where it needs to be returned or used
12:44
it's not to be leveraged to get our way even if we think our way is correcting existing evils in the church there's
12:52
this popular idea today that well it's my money and I'm responsible and I can't
12:57
give it to a place where I think they're doing something wrong because then that I would be guilty of that yes you would
13:04
if it was your money but it's not your money it's God's money and if God says put it here and you say ah Lord I don't
13:12
feel faithful putting it there you're Unfaithful if you don't do what God says and God has been clear about where the
13:18
tithe goes now we see this throughout scripture in fact one of the most famous
13:23
tithing passages the Malachi passage where we quote it when we're talking about tithing principles bring ye all
13:30
the tithes into the storehouse that there may be food in my house there may be meat in my house right uh the Lord
13:36
says and and see if I won't open the windows of heaven and pour you out such a blessing what a lot of people don't
13:41
understand about that passage is that the very context of Malachi is a corrupted priesthood go back and read it
13:48
read Malachi 1 and 2 going into chapter 3 where you find that verse and you will find that the priesthood is described as
13:55
corrupt and the implication is that God's people have been withholding their tithes because the priesthood is corrupt
14:02
but God doesn't come to him and say yeah I understand why you're withholding your tithes good on you you're being responsible he says you've robbed me in
14:09
fact he goes on to say return to me and I will return to you and not just return
14:16
your tithes the implication is the people who have stopped putting the tithe where the Lord says despite the
14:24
corruption and the leadership have actually backslidden from him that's the implication clearly
14:29
in the Book of Malachi so he says return to me and I'll return to you you robbed me in tithes and
14:36
offerings we see a similar uh situation in the days of Nehemiah Nehemiah came
14:42
back from Persia to Jerusalem to start the rebuilding of the walls he was
14:47
called back to Persia and in his absence during those reforms during his absence
14:54
a man by the name of toaya an enemy of the reforms of Nehemiah was actually brought in in and given a room in the
15:00
temple Storehouse and so people stopped being
15:05
faithful in their giving upon nehemiah's return He evicted tobah from the
15:11
storehouse and then he contended with the elders for not being faithful and returning their tithes in other words
15:17
the fact that tobiah was there in the storehouse did not exempt the people from a faithful returning of their
15:24
tithes you will not find that in scripture in the days of Christ he Comm amended the Widow who gave her two m to
15:31
the church that was about to kill him he didn't say well I wouldn't put it there listen bring it over here and put it in
15:37
our little money box which incidentally the Bible says in John 12:6 Judas was
15:42
stealing from so even the ministry of Christ had corruption in regard to the
15:48
giving but it was never to be used as an excuse not to support the ministry
15:53
according to God's plan nevertheless there have been church members throughout the years who have
16:00
thought themselves justified in withholding tithes or redirecting tithes when they felt the church leaders were
16:06
not faithful I've had it in my own experience when I started out in pastoral ministry as a late Pastor I was
16:12
in a conference for example the conference had invited a
16:18
spiritualistic Mystic to speak to our pastors at one of our meetings it was in the name of innovation and we had all
16:24
kinds of craziness going on and so I had people on that conference that would come to my church and bring me stacks of
16:32
money and say here this is my tithe you're a faithful Minister you're preaching the word and they're not preaching the word and so you know I
16:39
want you to take my tithe and I had to give them a little bible study on the tithe and let them know that it's not
16:46
yours to redirect God tells you to put it here and incidentally I pay my ties to this
16:54
conference that is clearly not doing the right thing once again you say well you
16:59
can't do that you're responsible for that then no I would be if it was my money but it's God's money and I'm
17:05
responsible if I'm faithful to do what he asks me to do we have some clear
17:10
counsel in the spirit of prophecy on this this is a statement from the book pastoral Ministry page 260 paragraph 2
17:16
Sister white says I pay my tithe gladly and freely saying as did David of thine
17:22
own have we given the a selfish withholding from God will tend to poverty in our own Souls Act your part
17:29
my brethren and sisters God loves you and he stands at the helm doesn't matter what human leaders you see God is the
17:36
overarching leader he's the one you're returning tithes to he stands at the helm if the
17:42
conference business is not managed according to the order of the Lord that is the sin of the Airing one that is the
17:49
one in the conference who's not handling it right it's not your sin it's their sin you be faithful and returning your
17:55
tithe this is what she's saying that's what I do this is what Ellen White say saying in that particular statement now
18:00
in another statement here from nine testimonies page 247 she says let none
18:06
feel at Liberty to retain their tithe to use according to their own judgment they
18:13
are not to use it for themselves in an emergency nor to apply it as they see
18:18
fit even in what they may regard as the Lord's work that one's pretty plain the
18:24
one before it was pretty plain this next one is pretty plain from testimonies
18:30
volume 9 page 249 this is just a couple Pages after the last statement I read
18:35
she says some have been dissatisfied and have said I will not longer pay my tithe
18:41
for I have no confidence in the way things are managed at the heart of the work well there you go I know their
18:46
viewers have said that's that's exactly it that's me I just like she said there
18:52
I have no confidence okay so how does she answer it notice but will you rob
18:57
God because because you think the management of the work is not right notice do not give the tithe because you
19:05
think the work is mismanaged is called robbing God not
19:11
faithfulness she continues but will you rob God because you think the management of the work is not right make your
19:17
complaint plainly and openly in the right Spirit not a mob
19:23
rally to the proper ones send in your petitions for things to be adjusted and
19:29
set in order but do not withdraw from the work of God and prove Unfaithful
19:35
because others are not doing right uh that's Crystal Clear councel that's why we have the position we do as 7th Day
19:42
avenus regarding the tithe that the eldering question was speaking contrary to add to the statements that I just
19:50
read this one regarding the work of a faithful Minister Pastor our ministry page 29
19:57
says are you Brethren preaching that part of the truth that pleases the
20:02
people while other parts of the work are left incomplete will it be necessary for
20:08
someone to follow after you and urge upon the people the duty of faithfully
20:14
bringing all the tithe and offering into the Lord's treasury this is the work of the
20:20
minister but it has been sadly neglected the people have robbed God and the wrong
20:26
has been suffered because the minister did not want to displease his Brethren God calls these men Unfaithful
20:34
stewards in other words it's The Minister's job to let the members know
20:40
that the time is not going to come where they're going to be diverting their tithe elsewhere that's the work of the
20:46
faithful Minister if a minister even gives the impression that now or some
20:52
future time is going to be a time to start choosing where to divert your tithes to he's preaching false Doctrine
20:59
so now let's talk about the remnant for a minute and this idea of a par Church movement again there are those who have
21:06
expressed that par church is just a supportive Ministry but we've already
21:11
seen that that's not the case the description given of the par Church Movement by the Elder in question is
21:17
that this is a movement when the church has become so apostatized that they have to withdraw
21:24
and not answer to the church anymore okay this is not a supportive Ministry uh furthermore I've had some people say
21:31
well he wasn't talking about now he was talking about if and when thus and so so happened uh down in the future that it
21:37
might have to be uh there might have to come a time when uh there would need to be a drawing away into this Parish
21:43
Church movement what some folks are failing to understand is that those who have studied this in the Bible and the
21:49
spirit of Prophecy who understand our Church's official position on this know that such a time is never going to come
21:55
the church is never going to reach that point of apostasy now listen sure it's
22:00
likely it's probable that the time is going to come when we won't have an organization anymore because of legal or
22:09
or economic reasons but it won't be because of apostasy reasons the church is not going to become so corrupt that
22:15
there's going to be another movement needed one of the clearest statements on this I'm going to share it from second
22:21
selected messages page 380 there are other places that this is referenced as well is this one you're probably well
22:28
aware of this it says the church may appear as about to fall but it does not
22:33
fall it remains while sinners in Zion will be sifted out the chav separated
22:39
from the precious wheat this is a terrible ordeal but nevertheless it must
22:45
take place now the church does not fall some of you watching say oh no no no
22:52
you're not reading that right when she says Church she's not talking about the Seventh Day Adventist organization or
22:58
denom ation she's talking about those faithful Believers the invisible church
23:04
sometimes we call it those faithful Believers everywhere that's the church that's not going to fall let me ask ask
23:11
you a question if that's what she's talking about who's needing to be sifted
23:16
out in the statement she says that the sinners in Zion the chaff in that church
23:24
will need to be sifted out if that church is the faithful Believers by very
23:31
definition there is no chaff in that church that's the true the true believers there's no chaff there this
23:38
could only be referring to the organization where there is wheat and
23:43
tears growing together where there are wheat and terrs growing together where there is chaff among the wheat and it
23:48
needs to be sifted out it must be talking about the organized church and that is the church that may appear that
23:55
it's about to fall but it will not fall why would you even need to say the the
24:01
the the faithful Believers won't fall they're faithful by virtue of the it's
24:07
the it's the church that the faithful Believers don't look like they're about to fall this is clearly speaking of the
24:12
organized denomination which is why we have such pointed Counsel on this topic
24:18
Last Day Events page 51 says when anyone is drawing apart from the organized body
24:24
of God's commandment keeping people talking about the denomination when he begins to weigh the
24:29
church in his human scales and begins to pronounce judgment against them then you may know that God is not leading him he
24:36
is on the wrong track again Last Day Events page 51 it says I know the church I know
24:45
sorry I know that the lord loves his church it is not to be disorganized or
24:50
broken up into independent Adams there is not the least consistency
24:57
in this there is not the least evidence the least evidence that such a thing
25:02
will be again first selected messages page 179 says you will take passages in
25:08
the testimonies that speak of the close of probation of the shaking among God's people and you will talk of a coming out
25:16
from this people of a pure Holier people that will arise now all this pleases the
25:21
enemy it does not please the Lord friends and finally second selected messages page 390 says we cannot now
25:29
step off the foundation that God has established we cannot now enter into any new Organization for this would mean
25:36
apostasy from the truth you can't get clearer than these
25:41
statements this has raised a serious concern at least in my mind of what this
25:46
elder in question has been teaching these doctrines are not in harmony with Biblical teaching they're not in harmony
25:53
with the spirit of Prophecy and I've had people say well he says a lot of good things
25:58
uh point taken but that does not take away from the fact that there is false
26:03
Doctrine being presented so let's review the situation you've got an elder of a church in Michigan who incidentally
26:10
carries ministerial credentials he's an ordained minister of the denom denomination you've got an elder of a
26:15
church in Michigan who is preaching Doctrine contrary to scripture in the spirit of Prophecy in other words one
26:22
who should be feeding the flock and caring for the flock is poisoning the flock even if he's mixing in the poison
26:28
with good food some people say again well he preaches good things that just makes the error more
26:33
deceptive in the 7 Adventist Church manual 2022 Edition Pages 67 and 68 it
26:39
lists out reasons for church discipline of any member let alone one carrying ministerial credentials the first reason
26:46
given is and these are not in order of importance but just these are how they're listed out the first reason for
26:52
church discipline the first grounds for church discipline is listed as follows denial of faith in in the fundamentals
26:58
of the gospel and in the fundamental beliefs of the church or teaching doctrines contrary to the same number 11
27:07
states persistent refusal to recognize properly constituted Church Authority or
27:13
to submit to the order and discipline of the church so when
27:19
corrected it isn't the correction isn't heed it isn't followed the conduct of
27:25
this eldering question called for some level of disciplinary action and in case you think this is just an ecclesiological thing some church thing
27:31
some organizational overreach the Apostle Paul is clear in first Timothy Chapter 5 19 and 20 as he's instructing
27:38
this young Minister he sayso not receive an accusation against an elder except from two or three Witnesses those who
27:45
are sinning rebuke in the presence of all that the rest also May fear he says
27:52
when an elder a leader somebody in this prominent position sins that sin needs
27:57
to be called out publicly so that everybody May fear they may be warned
28:03
they may understand not to go down that
28:08
direction yet for all the evidence and instruction the fact that yeah we see
28:14
we' the sermons are online you can hear you know these are not teachings that
28:19
are in harmony with 7eventh adven doctrines yet for all the instruction we have from the spirit of Prophecy yet
28:26
inspiration warns us in testimonies for the church volume 3 page 114 if persons are deserving of being separated from
28:34
the church if they are as deserving of being separated from the church as Satan
28:40
was of being cast out of Heaven they will have sympathizers there is always a
28:45
class who are more influenced by individuals than they are by the spirit of God and sound principles and in their
28:53
unconsecrated state these are ever ready to take sides with the wrong and give
28:58
their pity and sympathy to the very ones who least deserve it uh I'd encourage you to read that whole section and
29:06
finally sister white tells us in testimonies 3 page 269 god holds his people as a body responsible for the
29:14
sins existing in individuals among them this is commenting on the story of achen
29:19
in the Old Testament if the leaders of the church neglect to diligently search
29:24
out the sins which bring the displeasure of God upon the body body they become responsible for these sins that's a
29:33
heavy point that is made there the bottom line is that some action needed
29:38
to be taken the local leaders who admitted that this elder was teaching
29:43
things contrary to Aven belief refused to carry out their god-given
29:49
responsibility to correct the matter that's a local church issue if a if an elder is speaking false Doctrine in the
29:56
local church that doesn't need need to go to the conference in fact it
30:01
shouldn't have to go to the conference conference Brethren are busy with enough stuff that's why they put a local Pastor
30:06
to oversee things like that that's why you have the local church leadership they should have corrected the issue
30:12
they did not the local Pastor then who was paid from the holy tithe to protect the flock
30:19
also failed to correct the issue the Elder in question continued to preach false Doctrine in his defense the pastor
30:27
in question he claims to have addressed the issue with the Elder in fact he says he's he did it repeatedly but there was
30:34
no disciplinary action the Elder in question just kept preaching false
30:42
Doctrine now it seems odd to me to have to tell faithful 7day avenus that if
30:49
somebody if anybody is preaching false Doctrine in the Pulpit they shouldn't be permitted in the Pulpit but wow you go
30:57
on social media Med and this man was cancelled the church is overreaching and
31:04
seriously the man is preaching false Doctrine you say oh but but he's
31:10
preached some good stuff too listen to this statement from uh 23 letters and
31:15
manuscripts letter 330 1908 sister white tells us many times in our history it has happened that men who had been
31:22
effectual speakers wo into their belief some sentiments which if received would
31:28
result in the destruction of those who receive them it has been natural for these men to be coarse denunciatory and
31:34
rough yet they continue to teach some of the theories of Truth however we are to
31:40
give them no opportunity to speak in our churches for Satan has been working with
31:45
them our safest course is to let them alone notice they're preaching some truth notice that they have been
31:52
effectual speakers but they wo in some error and that error was dangerous and
31:57
that gave cause to not have them speak in our
32:03
churches that's from inspiration this should be a clear point so at this point
32:09
the conference who hired the pastor to feed and protect that flock had to step in and do the job the pastor refused to
32:16
do they had to do the pastor's job for him because he wouldn't do it the local Elders wouldn't do it even now the
32:23
pastor in question and the elders in the church in question refus to bring disciplinary action upon the Elder in
32:31
question there has been no discipline to date uh some people say oh he was banned
32:36
from speaking that's not a disciplinary action which I'll get to in just a moment uh that is a corrective action
32:42
for sure but the conference cannot discipline a local member and again
32:48
we'll get to that shortly so the Michigan conference leadership had to step
32:54
in and ban this elder from Michigan pulpits which is perfectly within their
33:00
rights and responsibilities as a conference and it's still not a disciplinary action
33:07
which for a member must be carried out on the local level now sometimes I get
33:12
to this point in the discussion or conversation and and and you know a
33:17
person is honest minded he or she will say no I get it okay the Elder in question was speaking things he
33:24
shouldn't have been speaking but why did the conference move so fast why didn't they take more time with him why didn't they hear him out why didn't they work
33:30
with the brother right this is what I I I see online in this courtroom of public opinion the conference acted too hastily
33:36
the pastor and Elder in question they haven't had time to express their own views or defend themselves I can tell you with certainty
33:44
that what appears to have been uh uh taking place in a matter of days or weeks has developed over years
33:51
furthermore both men in question have had more than ample opportunity to dialogue about their views and defend
33:58
their actions and positions more than ample I'll give you just a few examples that are the tip of the tip of the
34:06
iceberg immediately after the conference sent a letter to its pastors saying that the Elder in question should not be
34:12
permitted to speak in Michigan churches we had a meeting scheduled we being our department Sabbath school and personal
34:18
Ministries the ministerial Department our um District superintendents which our
34:25
conferen has broken up into 12 District districts and there's a pastor who is a superintendent over each one of those
34:31
districts uh so those superintendents and then conference Administration the president the secretary and the treasur
34:38
all met together for 4 days at our summer camp in the upper peninsula Camp
34:43
sagola okay we took a bus ride up together 9 to 10 hours a bus ride back 9
34:49
to 10 hours and we spent two solid days in discussion the purpose for that meeting was to go up and and talk and
34:57
plan about our mission in the Michigan conference going forward into 2025 that
35:03
was the goal of the meeting however because of the recent Banning of the Elder in question the pastor in
35:10
question uh wanted to spend time talking about that they had a religious liberty
35:16
weekend coming up and he really wanted the band to be lifted because they had advertised that the Elder in question
35:22
would be speaking in that uh weekend so we spent that entire time time instead
35:28
of talking about our mission planning talking about the church in question and
35:34
the Elder in question for two solid days from morning till night we had
35:39
discussion just so you know how it went if anybody in the room wanted to comment we had to raise our hand and get in the
35:46
queue and that means you know okay you go and you go and you go and you know you give preachers a microphone you're
35:52
going to be in the queue for a while so somebody says something I have a comment on that you wait an hour to speak except
35:58
for the pastor in question who was allowed to come in any time he wanted respond to every input because it was
36:04
about his uh church and and his Elder for two straight
36:11
days and I will tell you that we started circling the barn a few times and what I
36:16
mean by that is you start repeating yourself repeating the same things repeating the same arguments my only
36:23
point in saying that is when a person begins repeating himself or herself
36:28
and their arguments that means they've had ample time to talk about their position and this whole time was spent
36:36
discussing this issue and the pastor in question had the floor and at the end of
36:43
that meeting it was ultimately agreed upon by all present that the ban on the
36:49
Elder in question would remain in place and he shouldn't speak at that religious liberty weekend uh much to the shagrin
36:56
of the pastor in question uh in light of that the pastor
37:01
in question then communicated that decision of the conference to his local Elders uh in the
37:10
churching question and they felt it would only be fair for the conference
37:15
leaders to allow the Elder in question to express and defend his views in their
37:21
presence well he hasn't had a chance I know we we accuse him of false Doctrine let him speak for himself now I need to
37:26
make it clear that this elder in question had already met with conference Administration more
37:32
than once for multiplied hours over 3 hours in a sitting I can't tell you exactly how long but to be able to
37:41
discuss and share his viewpoints
37:47
however even though the time had already spent even though he had spent those multiple hours with the pastoring
37:54
question and Conference Administration discussing these things the president of the conference agreed to the meeting
38:01
requested and so six of us from the conference office took a trip to the
38:07
church in question for this meeting with the sole purpose of meeting with the
38:12
leaders of that church and the Elder in question to let him Express his
38:17
viewpoints these to discuss the the the doctrinal errors as we perceive them and
38:24
you know dialogue however when we showed up to the meeting the pastor in question had
38:31
chosen to redirect the meeting without letting the conference leadership know and he and the Elder in question decided
38:37
that the Elder in question wouldn't come to the meeting which was the whole purpose for the meeting we spent the entire day
38:43
until about 7:00 p.m. in discussion with the pastor in question and the elders once again having come from the meeting
38:49
in sagola there was a lot of repetition uh just stating the same
38:55
things over and over U just to a new audience and so I can understand that to a degree
39:00
but the Elder in question never came which had been the sole purpose for the meeting even now people are saying
39:08
online well the Elder he in question he didn't have an opportunity he did have an opportunity he had opportunities with
39:15
Administration on a number of occasions and then with six full-time employees from the conference office to come down
39:20
and hear him out in the presence of other Witnesses and what have you and he chose not to do it they decided they
39:26
wanted to do something different it was not because the conference wasn't willing I don't know I can't tell you
39:33
why they decided to divert their meeting but again a full day with uh the
39:40
conference to spend discussing viewpoints uh there's been ample
39:46
opportunity this decision was not a knee-jerk reaction it didn't happen overnight it didn't happen without
39:52
extensive dialogue both with the pastor and the Elder in question and with those
39:58
making the decision it was carefully thought out it was carefully discussed and it was carefully
40:04
processed all of this led ultimately to the executive committee making the
40:10
decision to place the pastor in question on administrative leave so that they
40:15
could find another Pastor who would actually carry out what the conference had asked I know that the pastor in
40:22
questioned he'll he's posted things online and written articles and said I always complied with what the conference
40:29
said I don't know what to say about that why did we have meeting after meeting after meeting after meeting if there was
40:35
compliance it was constant push back constant push back when the conference has to come in and do let me say this as
40:42
a pastor of 25 years the conference never would have needed to come to my church to handle an elder who was
40:48
preaching false doctrine that would have been something that I would have expected my elders to do and I certainly
40:54
would have done it and wouldn't have needed them to come in it's a it's a little odd that there's a lot of
41:01
armchair quarterbacking going on by people who say well the conference should have done this and should have done that by the very people in question
41:07
the pastor in question the elders in question conference wouldn't have had to do anything had they done their jobs so
41:13
the executive what do you do when you can't get a pastor to do what he's called to do they put him on
41:19
administrative leave and I need to clarify a couple
41:24
things here I've seen people arguing online that administrative leave is just
41:31
a politically correct way of saying fired or terminated wink wink I hate to disappoint the
41:37
mudslingers but this is not true there are policy differences between the two
41:42
things when an employee is fired or terminated from the 7th Adventist Church
41:47
that employee immediately ceases receiving wages and benefits however
41:53
when placed on administrative leave the employee continues to receive full pay
41:58
and full benefits for whatever period of time is specified my understanding is that this current period of time for the
42:04
pastor in question is to continue until the end of February that means he'll receive full pay and benefits until that
42:11
time that time can be extended by the executive committee there have been occasions where employees have stayed on
42:17
administrative leave for two years so there's a very distinct difference
42:23
between being terminated and being placed on administrative leave furthermore neither the pastor or Elder
42:30
in question have been disciplined disciplinary action in the sth Adventist Church involves either being placed
42:35
under censure or having one's name removed from church membership in the case of ordained ministers they have
42:43
their ministerial credentials revoked none of these actions have been carried out in the case of either the pastor in
42:48
question or the Elder in question both are still members in good and regular standing in the Seventh Adventist Church
42:55
so a lot of people are invoking policy that weren't followed in discipline
43:00
there was no discipline folks uh there should have been in my opinion but there hasn't been for whatever that's worth so
43:08
who are the faithful ones here is it the church that failed to carry out any kind
43:14
of disciplinary action on a man preaching false Doctrine from the pulpit or the
43:19
pastor is the Michigan conference now in apostasy because it's taken action
43:25
because it's tried to Safeguard the Integrity of the message being presented
43:30
from Adventist pulpits who is the one really contending for the faith once delivered to the
43:37
Saints I believe the answer is obvious and in the words of our Master he who
43:44
has ears let him hear I believe the Lord's allowed this
43:50
situation this chain of events to reveal things in our own hearts that aren't
43:55
right a Spirit of independence of animosity of drawing
44:00
apart rather than pressing together listen to this Council from testimonies
44:06
to ministers page 56 it says those who have proclaimed the Seventh Adventist Church as Babylon or papal they're the
44:14
same thing have made use of the testimonies in giving their position a seeming support but why is it that they
44:22
did not present that which for years has been the burden of my message the unity of the church why did they not quote the
44:29
words of the Angel press together press together press together why did they not
44:36
repeat the admonition and state the principle that in Union there is strength in division there is
44:43
weakness understand what sister White's saying she's saying why are these people taking those councils of mind that talk
44:49
about the errors in the church but they're excluding the councils where I'm telling our people they need to press
44:55
together and come together that they need to be United she continues it is such messages
45:04
as these men have borne that divide the church and put us to shame before the
45:10
enemies of the truth and in such messages has plainly revealed the specious working of The Great Deceiver
45:17
who would hinder the church from attaining unto perfection in unity these teachers follow the Sparks of their own
45:23
kindling move according to their own independent judgment and cumber the truth with false Notions and theories
45:30
they refuse the counsel of their Brethren and pass on in their own way until they become just what Satan would
45:37
desire to have them unbalanced in mind brothers and sisters I I don't think
45:44
these men are unbalanced in mind just yet but I believe that they're on a
45:50
course that could end there and I would appeal to you not to to continue
45:59
flattering men who should be reconsidering their ways not to be
46:05
denouncing the conference that has chosen to safeguard the
46:12
flock and not to be thinking that the church is now or ever will be in such a
46:19
state of apostasy as you need to be thinking about your other options in
46:25
closing I want to share with you a story story from our history about one of our most talented preachers a man by the
46:30
name of DM camri camri had stayed in the homes of James and Allen White many times he had uh had them as his
46:37
counselor throughout much of his ministry but camri knew he was a good speaker and he often became discouraged
46:44
because he felt he wasn't appreciated the way he should be uh he let his ego get a little bit bruised and so he would
46:50
leave the ministry and then the Lord would work on him and he would come back humbled but then he would leave again
46:56
and then he would come back but then he'd feel slighted and he would leave again and one of those times that he was
47:02
considering leaving threatened to be his last and before that time the lord gave
47:07
Ellen White a vision revealing his case she shares that in uh it's shared rather
47:12
in testimonies for the church Volume 5 page 571 it says I had an impressive dream
47:18
last night I thought that you were on a strong vessel sailing on very Rough Waters sometimes the waves beat over the
47:25
top and you were drenched with with water you said I shall get off this vessel's going down no said one who
47:33
appeared to be the captain this vessel sails into the harbor she will never go
47:39
down but you answered I shall be washed overboard as I'm neither captain or mate
47:44
who cares I shall take my chances on that vessel you see Yonder said the
47:49
captain I shall not let you go there for I know that vessel will strike the Rocks before she reaches the harbor
47:57
you straightened yourself up and said with great positiveness this vessel will become a
48:03
wreck I can see it just as plain as day the captain looked upon you with
48:10
piercing eye and said firmly I shall not permit you to lose your life by taking
48:17
that boat the Timbers of her framework are worm eaten and she is a deceptive
48:23
craft if you had more knowledge you could discern between the spirous and the genuine the holy and that appointed
48:30
to utter ruin the Lord was trying to convey to canri that to leave this
48:35
movement to go to another better one purer one Holier one was going to result
48:41
in his destruction kenri did leave the Seventh Adventist Church for the last time and
48:47
never returned brothers and sisters let's not make the same mistake
48:54
let's heed the words of our cap this vessel sails into the harbor listen
49:00
I know there are things that you don't understand there are things I don't understand about this situation about so
49:06
many other situations in fact there there's a a place we're told in Inspiration where when we get to the
49:13
kingdom the Lord is going to explain to us the great controversy and I am really looking forward to that explanation
49:19
there are questions that we have in this earth that will not be answered until then but listen to me clearly brothers
49:25
and sisters there's one thing we have to be clear about this vessel this ship this movement that
49:33
we're part of is going to sail into that Heavenly Harbor and I want you to be there and I want the pastoring question
49:40
and I want the eldering question to be there we've got to hold to that belief
49:46
we've got to hold to that confidence we've got to hold to the Council of our
49:51
Master he is the one who stands at the helm and he will share uh uh steer us
49:57
into that Port safely let's pray Father in Heaven father
50:04
we are so thankful for your love and your mercy to us all Lord we thank you for the counsel
50:11
you've given in your word and through your messenger we pray Lord as we reflect
50:18
upon these things first of all Lord we want to lift up the church in question
50:24
the pastor and Elder in question the conference the executive committee all
50:29
that are involved father I want to pray for us as members we are living in a Time on Earth's history where the devil
50:35
is seeking desperately to divide your church because he knows that we can't
50:41
finish our mission if we're not United Lord please unite us as a people help us
50:47
to carry the work forward I know that there are questions but Lord you have answers help us to trust that in spite
50:54
of everything we don't know you still stand at the helm and you are going to steer this ship into the Heavenly Harbor
51:02
Lord we want to be there when that happens we want to be on the ship and we want to enter into the kingdom together
51:09
this is our prayer and we pray it in Jesus name and for his sake
51:16
amen God bless you all and brothers and sisters stay with the ship
